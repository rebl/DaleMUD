You may find the key that opens up your soul.
Don't go to heaven,
Because it's really only hell.
Don't smell the flowers,
They're an evil drug to make you lose your mind.
Don't dream of women,
Because they'll only bring you down.

  A horde of mighty Viking warriors is charging from a Longboat straight
towards you, raising their swords and axes to split your skull.  In the boat,
you see a figure clothed in simple white robes, praying.  He seems to be 
illuminated by a soft white light.  Dark clouds cover the sky, and corpses
litter the ground behind the warriors.  You get an uneasy feeling when looking
at this mural.

is dressed in fine white robes, and he has several magical devices about him,
a ring, a holy symbol, a necklace and a wide belt.

Villian Priest Chambers~
As you slowly enter this sacred shrine, you see many black banners 
hanging from the stone walls. There is a small pedestal in the 
corner of the room and many small candles burn brightly giving off 
a bright glow. You see a variety of unholy symbols lying about and
wonder if the person that lives here is up to any good...

As you walk through the entrance you come out into a large square 
with many people doing business at their little shops and gossiping
on park benches. It is a bright sunny day out and the wind is blowing
in on you. You can spot many fruit stands in the distance and even
a tailor shop in the corner. To the east you spy a large room that 
sparks your curiosity.

stack of books entitled 'Notes On The Mud!'.  A large sofa sits in the
middle of the room, facing a ten foot high portal of some strange
make. In the south-east corner you can make out what looks like it
might be a computer.  Looking up you see a large NIN tapestry decorating
the ceiling, and an S shirt hanging from the ceiling fan.  You draw the
easy conclusion that Scream is not very tidy!

between two mountains which seem to stretch impossibly high into the

glisten with ancient snow.  Nearby, you can hear the trickling of a
stream, and then farther off to the south the pounding of a waterfall.
A slight breeze plays about you, and it makes the long grasses sway 
lazily back and forth.

The Hall of Rules~

	Welcome to the hall of rules.  "Rules" start at 667, and go through
670.   Note:  At the current time, these are a copy of the rules on Temple.
However, they will be rewritten.

671-675 is a list of godly duties.  If you want to move up in levels, I
recommend that you read it.  

More will be added as thought of.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
The mostly dont's of being immortal:

(1) On playing a mortal character:
    - ABSOLUTELY NO HELP WHAT-SO-EVER FOR ONE OF YOUR OWN MORTALS!
      The point being you have already achieved the goal of the game.
      By helping yourself in this way, you detract from others chances.
    - Don't pass on equipment, especially not to one of your own.
    - Don't give your 'old' characters to other people or I will treat
      them as if it is you. And DON'T let them play your immortal!
    - No playing both immortal/mortal types at the same time, there should
      be no legitimate need for this.
    - Similarly switching back and forth between mortal/immortal looks
      as though you are obtaining information to help you and you probably
      are, so don't.

(2) Assisting other players:
    - Advising a new player how to start is expected behavior, but
      advising him/her what his stats are or stats on an item is not.
      DO NOT inform people of object/monster stats!
    - DO NOT cast spells for mortals, and don't use spells against them
      ie casting Sanctuary on mobs.
    - Don't trans them around to avoid encounters or to put them in harms way.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
(3) On Dealing with problem players:
    Don't just up and kill them. Don't use info you receive as immortal
    to come on and hunt-down/summon players for the purpose of killing.
    (This is not to say you couldn't advise someone who they were killed
     by. Just make sure it stays their affair and not yours.)
    Do try to talk to them and inform them where they are going wrong.
    Be polite, but if they are not polite in return there is no reason to
    listen to them. If they refuse to listen, either inform a higher level
    or get a couple other immortal witnesses. Then move them out of harms
    way and if need be strip them of equipment.

You invested time and effort in making immortal, but it is a privilage and
comes with a responsibility to act responsibly. Violators will be delt with.
I not exclude the possibility of deletion, demotion or banning immortals.
You should read the wizard board each visit to stay informed of any changes
to policy.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
 If you wish to continue to play as a mortal there a few things I
would like you to keep in mind:

1) Don't be an item hog. You should not be keeping equipment for
   more than ONE player. If you play more than one character that
   is fine, but I would hope you wouldn't play more than one at
   a time.

2) The items you keep should be minimal. No reason why you should
   have 2 energy bows, a katana and a claw. You can't use them all
   at once so why have them. Same for armour and other items. If
   you can't use them at the same time you probably have too much.
   Items you get rid of should NOT be sold but put on the dump so
   they circulate back to the game and other people have the chance
   to experience getting them.

3) Avoid the urge to curry favor amoung people by 'starting' out
   newbies with a generous helping of experience points and or
   items. Give a modest amount of gold if you like or take them
   on a mini-tour of areas they can handle. They will have more
   fun if they can experience things for themselves. Anyone you
   group with should be of approximately the same level.

Temple rules on being immortal (supplied by conner)~
If you are noted violating these conditions your items may be removed
or if a repeat offender demotion or erasure or mortals may be called for.
I don't wish to restrict your playing entirely - I'm glad you enjoy what
I have created enough to go back for more. But you must keep in mind that
there are other people playing and they deserve to have the same opportunities
and struggles you hopefully went through.
 If there is anyone that can't live up to these responsibilities, you should
consider finding another mud to pass your time on.

This Is the office of Jim. It's not very big, but none the less
it is a office of some sort. 

On the walls are different monster heads of Jims Kills.

On the west wall you see Jims first "a vampire bat".

On the east wall you see "a black enfan", which nearly lost Jim
a lot of EXP. if he would have died.

On the south wall if you can reconize it, is a picture of Cichlid
and Qazzzzirumn, Jims mortals.

Under A Tree~
   Yuck!  All around you, there are big piles of some nasty white substance
that smells simply terrible!  Even worse, it looks like someone or something
has been collecting small amounts of this stuff for some unthinkably foul
purpose.
   CAW! CAW! Above you, a gigantic pteranodon takes flight!  Its enormous 
wings beat surprisingly fast, buffeting you with a blast of air.  The
pteranodon heads east, but you think there may be still more of them up in
the tree ...

The Pteranodon Nest~
   You struggle up into the upper branches of the old tree and find that
the pteranodon's nest is large enough and firm enough for humanoids to walk
on.  Cracked eggshells lie scattered all around along with an odd 
assortment of animal bones and decaying plant material.  Ack! Is that a
human femur you see off to the right?!?!

The Clearing~
   Ahhh!  The reeds part to reveal a nice clear area of hard ground!  The
grass is green, soft and inviting to you after your tiring travels through
the marsh.  Perhaps this would be a good place to set up camp before you
continue this perilous excursion.
   Ahead of you, there is a large boulder, which you estimate to be over
twenty feet tall!  Beyond the boulder is a shady tree in which you see signs
of movement and from which emanate strange cawing sounds ...

A Small Grass Hut~
   You lower your head to enter the small doorway of the hut, and your nose
is immediately assaulted by the pungent smell of some strange incense.  The
hut is unlit, but enough light comes in from outside to let you see clearly.
There are two copper braziers in which the incense is smouldering.  On the
ground, several white grubs wriggle and writhe.  All in all, this is a very
unpleasant place to be ... especially compared to that nice clearing to
the north.

Pig pen~

Gamgee Residence~
   You stand inside a modest home.  You deduce that this is indeed the home
of whomever owns the surrounding lands.  The air is somewhat musty and 
the smell reminds you of a stable.  As you look around disdainfully, you
think to yourself that this is more of a shack than a proper residence and
you long for the urban riches of the Shire proper.

horses and cows on your neck and you feel the sudden need for fresh air.
Other than that, you feel cozy and protected and don't mind staying for a
bit longer.  All the warmth and good vibes remind you of the days when your
mother would hold you in her arms and sing you to sleep.  You find yourself
wanting to cradle all the animals.

ready to offer you food and drink.  While most of the patrons are halfling
locals, you spy an occasional human or two.  As you listen more closely
to the conversations that fill the inn, you hear the tales of great and
seasoned adventurers as well as the usual gossip.  You feel as if you've

Exxon's Retreat~
     As you step through the mirror you feel a tingling sensation run
through your body.  Much to your surprise you are standing on dusty
clifftop overlooking a magnificient ocean.  The sun seems to be frozen
just over the horizon, turning the ocean into a swirling plain of gold
and black reflections.  A warm and gentle breeze brushes your face.
You hear the roar of the waves crashing rhythmically on the rocks below,
interspersed with cries of seagulls floating lazily overhead.
     To the north you can see a large city by the oceanside, far larger
than Shadowdale, perhaps far larger than any city you've seen before.  It
seems to extend infinitely to the north.  From this distance the city
resembles a spectacular field of colorful lights, twinkling before you
in silent majesty.

a small set of scales, which floats about eye level. In perfect balance,
the scales are no doubt a sign of the master's neutrality.

E
attacks~
The formula used for the number of attacks that an unarmed monk will get per
round will be: (level-1)/16 +1   --The fractional portion will provide the
probability of getting an extra attack each round. (ie. if you were VERY
lucky, a 2nd level monk could get 2 attacks every round, but probably won't)

[a few samples: Level--#Att]
 1--1.00    5--1.25    9--1.50   13--1.75   17--2.00   21--2.25   25--2.50
29--2.75   33--3.00   37--3.25   41--3.50   45--3.75   49--4.00

E
skills~
   At the time of this area's creation, monk skills had not yet been decided
or defined on effects. As soon as it is possible, this will be altered to
reflect the new information.

Dining Hall~
   A long Table fills the room and you get the impression that it probably could
seat the entire monastary at one time. Not that they would probably all eat
at the same time since someone always seems to be training or praying.

that certain monks keep. You see various cooking utensils, a firepit, and a
trapdoor that leads down to the Cellar. You also notice a sign on the
trapdoor that catches you eye.

               BOLD ADVENTURERS!!

   Recently, it seems that some nasty little monsters made a hole in our wall
dowstairs in the Cellar. We soundly trashed them and none of them have enough
courage to enter the Cellar again, however, the Monastary would appreciate it
if you would help us keep their numbers down and fear in their hearts.
   Though the Monastary could easily purge the menace, we just don't feel like
taking the time away from our prayers and training to do this. Any assistance
you provide would be appreciated and you may keep anything you find down
there as a reward for your help.

Cellar Under the Monastary~
   There is a Hole in the South wall that seems to lead to a tunnel. The
Cellar is lit up with some magical lights but the tunnel seems to be lit by
some sort of green light. The only other exit is through the trapdoor up
to the Kitchen.

At the Hole in the Wall~
   Apparently, someone or something made this hole in the wall into the
Monastary. Unfortunately, they didn't think things through and they were
completely stomped by the monks. The tunnel seems to be lit by some sort of
luminescent fungi with an erie green glow.

This is a place where one may come for deep meditation and quiet relaxation.
The walls of the room are adorned with maps, both finished with great detail
and others in the beginning stages of creation. Along the walls are wooden
chairs that look very comfortable, while being simple in design. Scattered
about the room are many old wands, scrolls, potions, and other assorted
paraphonalia, most of which became useless long ago. In the center of the room
is a large wooden table with many old books in very poor condition laying
scattered about and falling off unto the floor. A large chair is pulled
up close to the table with an senile old man lounging very fast asleep. On the
back of his robe is the name ATOR. His head has fallen onto an large
unfinished volume of an open book labeled:

NorthEast Corner of Grand Hall~
You have just entered the Grand Hall.  As all temples built during its
period it is designed in the Neo-Classical style.  But it contains
strange triangluar columns unlike anything you have ever seen before.
This is not the first them things have come in three's in the temple
there might be something important involved with that number.

As you gaze through the wind you can see the out-lines of the
town, you can see the post office to the west, a large park to
south, and the town shops around the square.  The sky is red with fire,
and in all directions you can see rifts on the horizon, for some
reason it looks like the world is fighting against a time vortex.

Entrance to Geldor~
  Tucked away in a little valley lies the village of Geldor.  I seems to
be quite a lovely little town.  The worn dirt road you've been following
has been cleaned up some, though there are still wagon tracks carved into
it.  Trees have been planted along the sides of it, making a sort of
entryway into the town.  Further ahead you hear the faint sounds of
laughter and dogs barking.  You catch a whiff of freshly baked bread on
the breeze.  The road continues north into the village and to the south
it leads back to the lonely road.
   There is a signpost here.

sign~

                            Welcome to Geldor

     Due to the recent attacks by bandits, travellers are strongly
advised NOT to go beyond the town's outer gates until we resolve the 
situation.

wagons over the ages.  To the east and west you can see small farms and
to the north lies the main part of town.

Small road~
  You follow a cute little road that twists and turns.  Along the sides
are well trimmed bushes and hedges.  You can hear the chirping of birds
as they flit about in the trees.  Farther ahead to the west, you can
make out two structures.

Prosperous Farm Cottage and Large Barn~
  You've come across a quaint little house with a neighboring barn.  The
cottage is a small but sturdy looking little building.  It has obviously
been well cared for by its owners, for you can see the roof has been
freshly thatched and the outer walls covered with a new coat of white
plaster.  Adjacent to the cottage stands a large barn from which you 
can smell horses and the scent of freshly cut hay.  A small cobblestone
path leads up to the front porch of the cottage where you can make out
the form of a plump woman smiling at you.  As you are standing there, 
two huge dogs come running out from behind the barn and bark at you
menacingly.

Modest Farmhouse~
   Clean but slightly run-down buildings indicate that this farm is not very
prosperous.  However, the stock appears quite healthy and plump.  Two active
lads of 12 or so can be seen working in the field to your northwest, 
supervised by a man who must be their father.  Nothing appears of particular
interest.

Barn~
  The barn is larger than many that you have seen.  It is full of some horses
and a cow, waiting to be milked.  Some chickens also wander around here,
pecking at the ground occasionally.  The barn is also well stocked with 
farming impliments, none of which would be of any use to you.

St. Cuthbert Road~
  After talking to the locals for a bit, you learn that this road is named 
after the patron god of the small town, St. Cuthbert.  To the west you can
hear the sounds of a blacksmith hard at work, the sounds of his hammers
ringing throughout this part of town.  To the north you can see a sign hanging
over the largest building in town, swaying ever so slightly in the small 
breeze that is blowing.  The few people walking along the road smile at you
as they pass.

  This is the dining room of the Welcome Wench.  All around you are people
eating, laughing, and having a good time.  A waitress gracefully navigates
her way through the crowded room, carrying a large platter of steaming hot
food.  Your stomach rumbles at the mere sight of it.  Over in the corner
sits a young man playing a lute.  Occasionaly one of the patrons tosses a
coin in his direction.  To the south you can see another dining room while
to the west you can see the bar itself.

is equipped with silverware, napkins, and candles.  Sitting in a plush
velvet lined chair sits a very large man.  He is just about to take a 
bite of food when you stumble into the room.  He pauses, looks up at
you with angry eyes and growls menacingly.  You can see his knuckles
whiten as he clenches his fork.  The only way out of the room is back

the others are occupied by large hairy men that occasionaly burst out
into bellowing laughter.  A bartender stands behind the bar, dexterously
refilling drinks and collecting money.  As you enter the room, he glances
up at you expectantly.  To the west, you can see the door to the kitchen
A wooden staircase leads upstairs.

  This kitchen must be the busiest place you've ever seen.  A cook stands
in front of a chopping board cutting vegetables and demonstrating such
skill with a knife that you'd never want to cross him.  Several serving
boys and girls rush around the kitchen darting in and out of the room 
carrying glasses and dirty dishes.  As you enter the room, the cook
looks up at you with an angry glare and motions with his knife for you
to get out.  The southern wall holds a thick wooden door, denying you
entry to the room beyond.

  An overpowering stench of alcohol assaults your senses as you walk in.
A simple white bed has been tipped over on its side, its sheets scattered
on the floor.  The mirror on the dresser is cracked and broken.  Over at
the desk sits a large individual whose face is a bright cherry red.
Around him are scattered bottles of wine and ale.  As you walk into the 
room he squints up at you with bloodshot eyes.  Without warning, he 
suddenly shouts, 'Invaders!' leaping towards you in a drunken rage!

preserve a body for weeks with some of the foul smelling stuff that the
leatherworker uses.  Looking over the wares, you see various leather goods,
all of them in excellent condition.  They look as if they could easily

the singing of hundreds of birds and the rustling of little animals.
To the south lies the main road.

  This is obviously a place of worship.  The trees are neatly pruned, and the

path leading to a rock cairn where flowers, nuts, berries, and garlands of
leaves are placed.  A small path leads beyond the shrine to a low-roofed
wooden building placed under the great boughs of the central oaks of the copse.
As you enter the clearing, a very wise looking man exits the house with a 
large black bear at his side and waits expectantly.

Looking eastwards, you see the eastern entrance to the town.

  This structure is some 55 feet tall, a smaller tower rising inside the

by going up a curving flight of stone stairs which terminate in a landing
about 10 feet above the ground.  The outer door of the tower lowers to form a
bridge to the stone landing.  There are numbers of arrow slits around the
tower, and it has a splay around the base to about 6 feet in height.
   The lower and upper battlements are machicolated, the merlonds being 
pierced for archery as well.  A very formibable place indeed.
   Upon entering the tower, you find yourself facing a rather large fighter
and a mage, who both look at you inquisitivly.

  You are standing at the entrance to Midir, within you see cookfires being
lit for the coming dusk, the wafting aroma of roast and freshly baked bread
makes your mind drift to the thought of a comfortable bed and a real meal
for a change... Yet you sense that something is amiss in this sleepy little
community, something dark and sinister... You shake your head to clear it,
attributing these thoughts to road weariness and your sometimes overactive
imagination.  To the north of here lies the waterside hostel and to the east
is the infamous Boatmens' Tavern.

Stepping inside you hear the shouts of drunken patrons and above that the
screaming voice of the cook who is desperately trying to put out a grease
fire in the kitchen.  As you look about a disgusting brute of a man shoulders
you aside on his way out reeking of sour ale and smoke.  Off in the rear of
the room is a rickety old staircase leading upstairs.  To the north is the
bar.

over to where you are sitting.  He looks you up and down, assessing you and
calculating just how much he can charge you for a drink.  He wipes his mouth
with the sleeve of his shirt and tells you to order something or get out.

safer though, the smell of stale beer and urine permeates the entire place.
It seems to be emanating from the room to the north.  The hall continues
to the west and there is a door to the south.  The only other exit is
back down those stairs...

Trashed room~
  A hideous stench assaults you as you make your way past the rubble 
blocking the entrance to this room.  All the furniture here has been torn
to pieces.  The mattress is nothing more than a soggy pile of stuffing, 
reeking of ale.  You wonder just what went on here.  The only way out is
to the south.

except to the west where you can smell bad tobacco being smoked in vast
quantities.  The door to the west is a little nicer than the others in this
hall and you can hear noises from the other side.  There are also doors
to the north and south.  The hallway continues to the east.

is hot and full of smoke.  Large men with greasy beards sit at the table 
laughing and talking to each other.  Occasionaly, one will drive the tip
of his dagger into the table to emphasize a point.  The only way out is

old iron stove, half full of water, and there is a hunk of stale bread in

There, in the trees staring at you, is a giant two-hundred pound squirrel
with an acorn the size of a small child!  It chitters at you angrily and
disappears into the trees.  You shake your head in disbelief, maybe you'd
better keep moving.

Road~

can also see a dilapidated building to the north and you feel a sense
of disquiet as you strain to see more, however to the south of here
is Mother Screng's herb shop and the aroma's of her herbs that are
hanging from the shops rafters makes you giddy in the head.

all packed into bottles that lie on shelves throughout the room.  Every kind 
of spice and herb you have ever heard of(and then some!) are here.  You
look around and spot and old and bent lady, with scraggly gray locks sticking
out from beneath the aged shawl she wears drawn about her head.  Another 
old woman, who appears to be the first's daughter watches you from behind her
mother.  They both stand behind a counter in the back of the room.

You notice a table hidden in a shadowy corner of the room.  At it are two

and despoiled.  Leaves and dirt cover the floor, and cobwebs hang from walls

Vestibule~
  The floor of this area consist of reddish brown slate-like squares.  The
walls are plastered and painted with scenes of despicable acts of torture,
maiming, killing, and other which are too disturbing to look at for long.
The beliefs of the worshippers is all to evident:  Evil is to be flaunted,
practiced, and praised.  A dim light filters through the stained glass windows,
casting revolting colors on the greenish stones to the north.
  In that direction you can see the nave of the temple.  The pillars there
have been constructed from a pinkish mineral, shot through with worm-colored
veins.  The arches they form lead to two lesser aisles and are worked in a
bas relief that mimics the imagery of the walls.  Most likely this area was
reserved for the lowliest of the Temple's disciples.

thank the rest.  Just north of the altar is a circular, marble-lined pit-a
well of sorts-20 feet in diameter.  Shards of broken crystal vessels lie about
the well, near the altar, and scattered about the floor.  A crystal knife 
with a broken blade lies atop the stone block.

violently assaulted and destroyed.  A few links of bronze chain, a twisted
manacle, and a bronze-wood maul with a snapped haft add to the impression
that the enemies of the Temple who did this must have found the altar very
hateful indeed.

each rises about 18 inches, the inner being 14 feet in diameter, thus forming
a three feet wide step along the rim of the lower tier.  The lower disc is
greenish black stone, the upper blackish green.  The center of this altar is
a depression about eight feet across, filled with scummed-over black liquid.
Several pieces of smashed shells are scattered around the area, along with a

and evidently others similar over hung there, but their bronze links were
broken, and short pieces lie on the floor around the area.  The altar's rim
is dented and cut, as if struck by many hard blows.

Large Vestry~
  The portal to this room is finely carved, but most of the vile and obscene
work has been hacked and chopped so as to efface its evil.  You stand now in
a large vestry, measuring at 30 feet wide by 60 feet long.  It once must have
been the scene of debauched revels, for the remains of great couches, tables,
and padded chairs are strewn about.  Charcoal and several broken barrels lie
nearby.  A stack of resinous faggots near the door seem to be the only things
not broken or disarrayed.  Amidst the litter are several skeletons, probably 
human.  One wears the tattered remains of a scarlet robe.

Intersection~

dust clogs your nose as you breathe.  Over in the corner of the room is a
small staircase leading upwards.  To the north, east and south are large
archways leading off into dark tunnels.

thick in places, piling up against the walls in little drifts.  The only
other exit from here is to the north.

Armory~
  This plain chamber is filled with wooden racks for various spears, pole arms,
and smaller weapons.  The walls have many pegs indicating where other weapons
and shields once hung.  All that remains now are broken weapons, sundered
shields, and ruined coats of mail.  Several skeletons, both human and gnolls,
lie scattered here and there, as well as odd skulls and bones.  Cobwebs hang
in places; if any creatures have been here, visits are not frequent.

Room with a Broken Altar~
  The south wall of this chamber bears a bas relief of a hideous head, a 
human-like face with squashed features, the face low upon a mushroom-shaped
cranium.  Various humanoids, monsters, and demonic creatures prance and jape in
the background.  The remains of a sandstone altar lie in fragments before 
this sculpture.  All furnishings are gone, but six heaps of old clothing, rags,
and what-not remain, indicating that something yet dwells herin.  As you look,
6 ghouls stand and approach you.

  This huge place is over 100 feet long and 30 feet wide in the main portion.
The litter of tables, trestles, benches, chairs, and stools scattered about
the place show that great revelries of Evil were once conducted here.  Bits
of tapestries and drapes still hang here and there from the walls.  Bones and
whole skeletons can be seen on the floor and under the heaped broken furniture.
A skirmish in the greater battle for the Temple was surely fought in this
place!  Nothing of apparent worth remains.

  A ten-foot alcove is in the northeast corner of the room.  Its walls were once
plastered and painted, but where the covering still remains, some sort of mold
or similar growth has discolored it sufficiently to make the colors and 
subject matter undistinguishable.  Bones are heaped in a pile in the alcove,
and a disgusting odor lingers about the place.  Torn cloth and old cushions
are piled to form two tangled nests of bedding near the south door.  A large
iron-bound chest with a heavy padlock stands in the southeast corner.

  This place is 20 feet by 30 feet.  A high, broad fireplace with numerous side
ovens dominates the north wall.  The fireplace is large enough to roast a 
whole ox.  The room is littered with broken containers and dishes, trash of
an unidentifiable sort, and pieces of wooden tables, counter tops, and the 
like.  Several skeletons are visible, including one which appears to be that
of an ogre.  From the depths of the fireplace comes to warning sound of a
large snake hissing, one who does not appear to like you.

  The light in this 30 foot square room comes from four torches, one on each
wall, and several large candles standing on long trestle tables.  Also on the
tables, which are flanked by benches, are food, drink, and knucklebones.  The
dishes and vessels are ordinary pottery.  Narrow three-tiered bunks line the
north walls and weapons racks indicate that this room was originally allocated
as a place for guards.  The racks are full of various weapons and shields.  A
fountain in the south wall flows into a wall basin, under which are four large
knobs.  The corridor to the south curves to the east after exiting the room.
The exit to the north curves off to the west.

  Lurid light from a flaming cresset and a glowing brazier full of charcoal
reveals a 30 foot by 20 foot chamber containing a rack, iron maiden, cage,
and all the other unspeakable devices common to a torture chamber.  Two 
adjacent 10 foot square alcoves, one to the south and one east, are barred,
their doors held fast by chain and padlock.  Two prisoners are in each, 
obviously await the tender mercies of the torturers.  Two female humans are
in the south alcove, and two orcs in the east.

beige as it proceeds eastwards, but deepens to a dark chocolate hue to the
south.  Large bronze cressets are staggered at 10 foot intervals on either
side of the hall; someone or something obviously keeps them fueled and 
burning brightly.

  This plain room contains little of interest.  A peg shoved between the blocks
of stone on the west wall holds a robe of dull black cloth adorned with a pale
brown pattern, a pair of triangles one atop the other.  In the southeast corner
of the room stands an old battered table with two chairs, a stool, and a bench
clustered around it.  A cask is on the table, with some earthenware mugs and 
bits and pieces of food.  Three torches burn in wall sconces, and eight fresh
ones lie on the floor.  An open cupboard in the northeast corner displays old
plates, several mugs, lumpy sacks, and a string of small dried sausages.

Pit Chamber~
  A relatively short flight of stairs leads down to a 20 foot long walkway,
10 feet wide.  To the north of the walkway is a pit, 20 foot square and 30
feet deep.  The floor of the pit is slimy and covered with bones and filth.
The rough stone walls are pocked with small openings near the floor, but
they become smooth and unclimbable four feet about the floor of the pit.
  You soon discover just how unclimbable they are when the passage way tilts
up, spilling you right into the pit.  You are trapped.  The sound of your
falling attracts some rats, who rush out of the walls.  The rats are easy to
kill, but for every one you kill, another pours out of the wall.  You see 
that death might come soon.

Earth Temple~
  This great open area is obviously the one in which the principle of the
Elemental Evil of Earth is served.  The walls are rough-hewned sandstone, but
the entire floor is dark brown earth.  Light is given off by some sort of
phosphorescent lichen spread throughout the room.
  In the center of the room, occupying a 20 foot square area, is a pyramid of
hard packed dirt; the sides rise about six feet, and the top is flat.  Atop it
is a stone column, each of its four faces bearing a carved triangle and 
sporting a pair of bronze manacles dangling from bolted rings.
  The only door, to the south of the room, has a window in the face of it and
is barred by a heavy lock.  Through the window you can see a stairway leading
up.  As you look around the room, the dirt around you rises up to and starts
to form into four creatures.

  The southern face of the door to this place is sheathed in bronze, and bears
a peep hole.  The bar on the inside is very thick.  The walls herein are hung
with tapestries and rugs, and the floor is covered with several layers of
carpets.  A pair of bronze lamps light the place, suspended on chains from
the ceiling.  A brass brazier on a tripod makes the room both too warm and too
stuffy from the smoke of incense.  A divan, small table, two chairs, and a
cupboard stand along the east wall.  A large armoire with side drawers stands by
the west wall.  The table holds a silver flask, several ceramic dishes and
cups, and some foodstuffs.

Corridor of Bones~
  For at least 100 feet of its length, this 20 foot wide corridor is covered
with bones.  Skeletons of humans and humanoids are mixed in a terrible jumble.
Many skulls and loose bones seem gnawed.  The complete skeletons though, still
wear sundered armor, dented caps, or sprawl by broken shields.  Bent and 
broken weapons likewise testify to a great melee having taken place here; a
hundred, two, perhaps more...all met death here.  Further progress along the
corridor requires carefully picking a path between these grim remains of the
Temple hordes.  As you get about half way through the room, 10 human skeletons
and 6 gnoll skeletons rise up from the ground and surround you.

the west.  Two torches give light to the area.
  A trapezoidal area through the archway to the north contains four narrow cots
four small wooden chests, and a small wall fountain which dribbles smelly 
water into its basin.  A long table with two benches and a chair at head and
foot complete the furnishings.  Light comes from a lantern, held aloft above the
table by a thin chain; two unlit torches are mounted on the walls.  An open
cupboard by the table holds various dishes and four jugs.

  Perhaps this was once a reception room or minor council chamber.  Bits of
wall coverings still dangle here and there, and a once fine hardwood sideboard
is centered along the north wall.  Atop it are various dirty dishes, a cask of
beer, and bits of stale bread and dried meat.  The entire length of the west
wall is lined with piles of bedding, divided into eight pallets.  A small
wall font still trickles a sulphurous smelling water into a stone basin in 
the northwest corner.  A stack of wood lies by the south door, possibly for
use in some nearby fireplace.  A 5 foot wide alcove can be seen in the east
wall, near the northeast corner.

couches have been shoved together to form a huge bed in the northeast corner.
Several empty sacks lie on the floor, and a nearly full barrel of ale is near
the west door.  A large table and rude chair are in the northwest corner; a
big, yellowish cheese and several hard sausages lie atop the table. beside an

  You have entered an incredibly large chamber.  The ceiling is lost in the
darkness above you.  The walls here have been cut from a granite-like stone
and have been polished to a mirror finish.  The floor here is covered in a 
thick layer of dust.  Looking closer you can see hundreds of tiny footprints
from the rodents that infest this foul place.  To the north is an archway
lined with bones.  To the east and west are small archways, both leading
off into the inky blackness.

Sentry Room~
  The bare stone walls of this place have only a peg or two here and there, 
and three brackets with unlit torches in them.  The floor likewise is plain
stone blocks.  A rude wooden table is against the east wall, just south of 
the eastern door, with three stools nearby.  A small keg full of water stands
in the northwest corner, and next to it is a mound of ordinary looking dirt.
Like the exit to the east, the exit to the south also contains a door.

  Unlike most of the other tunnels in here, this one is straight.  It goes
east and west without a single curve.  You stand here for a moment and 
wonder why the designers of this place made such a simple passage in an
otherwise insane maze.

Intersection~
  This is a small room with a flight of rickety stairs in the far corner.
A crumbled archway opens up to the west and another to the north.  From
the opening above you, the ghostly sounds of chanting float through the air.

  A sense of deja vu suddenly strikes you.  Have you been here before?
The tunnels have all started looking the same ever since this morning.
You long for the fresh clean air and sunny skies above.  The cold, damp
chill of this place saps your strength, making you irritable and jumpy.
The tunnels here branch off in all directions, each one leading off into
the unknown.

Pillared Room~
  This 70 foot by 30 foot chamber appears deserted.  It has probably served as
a privy, for the place has a foul fecal odor and filth is scattered here and
there on the floor.  The columns which support the ceiling 40 feet overhead
are thick, four or five feet in diameter.  A few skulls and bones lie around
the pillar bases.  As you enter the room, from the above comes a horrible 
singing of voices and two bird like creatures, with human faces decend.

Gnoll Sleeping Chamber~
  The walls of this place are of plain stone.  Doors to the north and west
are normal.  Four heaps of bedding, made up of rags, torn tapestries, rugs,
etc, lie by the south wall.  Two stools stand near the entrance to the south
passage.  Opposite this entrance, along the wall, is a crude shelf, supporting
several samples of pottery, bottles, and mugs.  Under it, in the northwest
corner, stand four spears.  As you enter the room, you see four gnolls
standing around talking.  The look up at your approach.

Room With Alcove~
  Carpets and tapestries cover the plain stone walls of this room, and a few
rugs are on the floor as well.  From the appearance of all this, the room was
once the quarters of some fairly important person - an underpriest of the
Earth Temple, from the scenes depicted on several tapestries.  Whatever
furniture was once here is now gone.  Heaps of cloth lie near the walls,
showing where the inhabitants sleep.  A small brazier stands in the northeast
corner.  A small keg of cheap beer is in the center of the room.  The only 
exit is the door in the south wall of the alcove.

  This place is plastered and the floor paved with polished brown granite

chamber.  Many cushions and pillows are piled so as to make beds in the 
northeast and northwest corners of the room.  A half-empty wine barrel and a
like container with a few salted fish stand along the south wall.  Another
barrel there holds seven long spears.  Pegs on the wall hold one shortbow and
three quivers, each containing 10 arrows.

  A partially destroyed stone chair dominates this place.  It is hewn of brown
marble, veined with black, and stands near the middle of the north wall.  Both
arms have been broken off, and the seat is chipped.  A piece is missing from
the back, and the whole is fractured.  Rubble and broken furniture are strewn
about the room.  The ceiling overhead is at least 35 feet high - possibly more,
lost in the shadows of the supporting arches.  The stench of rotting flesh
faintly lingers throughout the area.

to the room immediatly to the north.  The phosphorescent gleaming 40 feet or so
above have a bluish cast.  In the center of the floor is a circular depression
about one foot deep and ten feet in diameter.  Around it is a low stone seat,
so low that only a halfling could comfortably sit upon it - or human if they sat
facing inward.  To the south is a hexagonally shaped chamber.

each small dot obviously representing a star and the combinations making 
miniature constellations.  A broken obsidian altar stone stands in the center
of the chamber; the place is otherwise empty.  An arched exit, about 7 feet
wide and 12 feet tall, breaks the smooth curve to the south.  Something is
scribed into the archway.

might retreat and ponder the glories of Earthy Elemental Evil.  A huge eye is
painted on the ceiling and seems to glare down upon all in the place.  Padded
benches still line the walls, and several chairs remain intact.  From the
condition of these seats and the look of the floor, this ghastly chamber is
still frequented on occassion.

This place is a welter of smashed flasks, broken pottery vessels, glass shards
all amidst the scattered remains of the contents of these containers - herbs,

Even the shelves and benches which held these things are now broken and strewn

Octagonal Chamber~
  Illumination in this octagonal room seems to come from everywhere - ceiling,
walls, floor - a milky radiance which gives a dim and eerie glow to the whole
scene.  The floor of this place is 15 feet below the level of the normal 
dungeon floor, with short broad stairways leading to it.  The ceiling vaults
to a height of 40 feet.  The walls and floor of the room is partially obscured
by swirling, eddying, softly glowing mist.
  In the center of the area is a great pierced square of bronze, ten feet on a
side.  A dome is pierced in the northern ceiling, a circular shaft some 20 feet
wide opening directly over a pit of the same diameter and five feet depth.  
Immediately to the south of the pit is a block of alabaster two feet wide, four
feet high, and eight feet long.  Atop it are two knives and a bowl of finest
crystal.  Flanking the pit are two crystal braziers, suspended from tripods by
chains of silver.  Each emits a faint sickly-sweet perfumed smoke.

Hall of Triumphal Evil~
  This huge, echoing hall was evidently once the scene of great revels
celebrating the triumphs of the Temple.  The floor of the place is littered
with skeletons, skulls, and bones of humans and humanoids.  Here and
there are parts of broken chairs, stools, tables, benches, sideboards, buffets,
cabinets, and cases.  Much of the wreckage has probably been carted off for
firewood.  Tapestries and trophies still remain on the walls in spots.  The
former show scenes of raiding, looting, pillage, and raping; trophies include
mummified heads, torn battle standards, hides and skins, battered shields,
sundered armor, and a broken broadsword.  Dozens of empty cressets and sconces
line the walls.  The broad steps at the northwest wall are dull black stone,
and the descending stair seems most depressing and horrible - though passable.

wall spills into a basin below it.  Rush mats cover the floor, and a few
ragged tapestries adorn the walls.  Two small kegs(of beer, by their aroma) are

  A not-very-secret door is in the west wall at the bend in the corridor. 
Above it, positioned horizontally, is a large beam, studded with sharp spikes.
It seems to be fastened to a hinge at the west end, and supported by a cord at
the east, which connects to a fastening on the door.  None of the bunks block
the door or stand below the beam.

depict.  A few pieces of battered furniture - couches, chairs, and stands -
remain along the walls.  In the center of the room is a shallow pool, its
fountain apparently stopped and the decorative statue, of a minotaur sitting
on a throne, much dirtied.  Several skeletons lie about the place, and some
odd skulls and bones as well - mostly humans, but some humanoids also.  None
of the many cressets and wall sconces are lit; no torches remain.

Hall of Verdigris~
  This whole room is damp, reeking of rotting seaweed and salt air.  A sense
of evil prevades the room.  The room itself stands 40 feet by 90 feet, with
an arched ceiling which is at least 30 feet high.  Soft cloudy greenish
luminosity seeps from the walls and floors, seeminly floating in the air,
making the whole chamber appear as if deep underwater.  Several weird things
in this room come to your immediate attention.
  In the middle of the west wall is a great sheet of bronze, a bas relief of
an underwater vista - seaweed, shells, and various forms of marine life.  The
head of a fish-like thing projects from this, a most hideous visage.  Its
ghastly maw emits a stream of water, which falls into a tiered series of four
basins.  The fourth and largest never overflows, so it must have drainage.
  Each corner of the room contains a column surmounted with a gargoyle-like
statue of bronze and coated with verdigris.
  There is a large idol here.

idol~
  In the mouth of a 20 foot wide alcove south of the altar basin stands this
idol or statue of serpentine stone, expertly sculpted to depict a writhing,
amorphous, agglomeration of fish, eels, octupi, and other marine monsters.
This horrid thing is about eight feet high and nearly as broad, the whole 
forming a globular mass standing about four feet from the altar basin.  The
statue is so realistic that it almost seems alive.

Corridor of the Elements~
  This 20 foot wide passageway is strangely lit by some obviously magical
means.  In the center and the short northern extensions it pulses with a 
disgusting gray luminosity; to the west it glows with a green radiance; and
to the east, bands of dull red light seem to float in the air.  Each pair of 
double doors(to the north, west, and east) is a great brass construction,
covered with horrible scenes and leering faces.  To the south is a huge slab
of bronze, a solid portcullis.  A mighty windlass flanking it to the east
obviously raises and lowers this barrier.  You notice that the slab isn't 
conterbalanced though, so as soon as you let go of the windlass, the door soon
falls back down to meet the floor.

Lounge~
  This 20 foot by 30 foot room is furnished in rich green - rugs, carpets,
draperies, furniture, etc.  Four bronze pedestals(one in each corner of the
room) hold green globes of some odd sort, which provide a greenish illumination
for the area.  Two unholstered armchairs and side tables are to the north.
The center of the room is dominated by a long table with four chairs.  Upon
the table are green vessels - a decanter, six goblets, several bowls and plates,
a basin, and a small box.  A high desk stands against the west wall just south
of the door; upon it are a few scraps of parchment and writing tools.  A large
wardrobe stands by a door in the south wall.  You notice that the exit to the
south curves west as soon as it leaves the room.

Pool Chamber~
  This large room is fashioned of great blocks of polished serpentine, save the
domed ceiling of polished crystal - made to reflect everything in the room in a distorted way, concentrating light upon the center of the large oval pool of
water in the center of the chamber.  The whole place seems to be lit with a     blue-green light from this pool, and at the same time the pool seems to absorb
light, capturing it in its heart.  Pale green flames come from eight bronze     cressets, four on the east wall and four west; the flames shed light but not
heat.  Tapestries of vilest sort cover the east and west sections of the north  wall.  The south wall shows a mosaic of some great ten-armed octopoid monster,
holding a sacrificial victim in each tentacle.  The monster fashioned from dark tiles, with reddish highlights and green orbs.
  The pool is an oval, 20 feet across and 30 feet long, set in a basin of small lapis lazuli tiles.  The crystal-clear water allows vision to the very bottom

Salon~
  This place is swathed in rich green, even the ceiling being obscured by
gossamer green hangings.  Tapestries on the walls show scenes of undersea
cruelty and death.  A large bronze brazier stands in the middle of the floor,
sending off curls of sweetish fishy-smelling smoke, flanked by hanging bronze
lamps which shed a green glow throughout the room.  Six plush armchairs are
here, each with a matching footstool and low table.  On each table is a small 
decanter, a bowl of nuts and fruits, and a stemmed cup of serpentine.  In the
center of the west wall is a couch of green velvet piled with pillows.  A 
round table before it holds an ivory tray, upon which are heaped many seashells.
An armoire stands to each side of the south door.

Side Room~
  This small room was evidently meant for minor functionaries of the Water 
Temple, for shreds of green draperies still hang from the walls, and part of a
dirty green carpet remains in the southwest corner.  Four heaps of material,
evidently used as sleeping mats, are evenly spaced on the floor.  A long bench
stands by the east wall, under which is a small keg.  A large barrel stands
near the north door, with a lumpy sack nearby.  Several green cloaks hang from
wall pegs.

The Temple of Fire~
  There can be no doubt that this huge hall of red granite, lit by scores of
flambeaux and pervaded by the odor of heated metal and sulfur, is the Fire
Temple.  Tapestries adorn the walls of the north(wider) section, depicting
scenes of fire in evil form.  Despite the many torches and flaming cressets, theair seems to carry motes of rust-colored luminescence, and the streaks of blue
and mica flakes in the polished granite walls appear to leap and dance as if
flames, caught within the rock.
  A brass tube, 20 feet long and 2 feet in diameter, is suspended from the 
ceiling by chains of the same metal.  Just to the north of it is a shallow fire
pit; and to either side of the tube are low stands of brass, upon which are many
small blocks of charcoal.  To either hand, east and west beyond lines of pillarsare great copper cauldrons, flanking the main area of the Temple.  Before 
each such vessel is an octagonal brass table; on each table are 16 bowls.
  There is a large pot here.

pot~
  A glance into the huge pots find them filled with some sort of glowing amber
liquid.  At the south end of the Temple stands a translucent block of golden
apatite, three feet wide and high and nine feet long.  Skulls grin from its 
sides, their forms inlaid with hammered gold.  Atop the altar is the 
eight-pointed fire symbol, set in wrought gold.  Before this altar is a fire
pit of diamond shape, ten feet long north-south and eight feet broad.  It appear
to be several feet deep, and its bottom is covered with glowing hot coals.
Tiny forms seem to cavort atop these coals - perhaps small denizens of the
Elemental Plane of Fire.

Audience Chamber~
  This lavishly furnished 30 foot square chamber is dimly lit by torches in
sconces on the east and west walls.  The many cressets and candelabras are
unlit.  Colors here are hot, bright ones - reds, oranges, and yellows.  The
tapestries on the walls depict scenes of the triumph of the Elemental Evil of
Fire.  Cushions, low tables, and stools are all about, but only one chair is
here - a huge wooden seat, laquered red and gilt.  A gold skull appears on 
the arm rests and above the back.

Main Chamber~
  This 20 foot by 30 foot chamber is thickly strewn with rugs; carpets and 
tapestries cover the walls.  Illumination comes from several candelabra, 
hanging lamps, and a fireplace.  Plush furniture and soft cushions are 
everywhere.  The colors are all bright - scarlet, hot orange, fiery gold, and
brilliant blue.  Small tables hold ewers and cups, and dishes of nuts and 
sweetmeats.  The plastered ceiling is painted with scenes of demons and
humans in lewd activities.  Under a heap of pillows is a hooded robe of 
scarlet hue.
  There is a picture hanging on the wall here.

picture~
  The picture hanging on the wall here shows three huge, evil looking demons
standing on a fiery plane with scorched rocks around their feet.  They appear
to be somewhere in hell more than likely.  They each are having their fun 
with three human peasants.  One of the demons is in the act of raping a 
beautiful female.  She is sprawled over a rock, her hands scratching in vain
at the demon holding her down.  The demon has a look of total bliss on it's 
face.  Another demon is holding a male child by his neck, his claws drawing
bloody from the young child's neck, while his other hand is debowling the 
child, spilling his innards on the floor.  The third demon holds an adult male
from behind.  You gather that this man is the wife of the women and the child's
father from the look of pure agony that graces his face.  The demon is forcing
him to watch all the preceedings.  All the demons wear an evil looking sneer
on their snouts.

Bugbear Room~
  A fireplace on the east wall and a flowing fountain and basin on the west
wall are the most remarkable features of this plastered but unpainted chamber.
A large table stands in the center of the room, flanked by a pair of benches;
all are a bit too large to be comfortable to humans.  A sizeable haunch of some
sort of cold meat is on the table.  An old barrel stands in the center of the
north wall, and holds seven spears.  Heaps of bedding lie along the south
passageway to the west.

placed to bar further progress north, though 10 foot wide corridors lead east
and west.  This portal is too massive to even attempt to raise by brute 
strength.  You can go east or west.

and gouge marks everywhere else below ten foot height.  The room stinks.  An

Room of Bones~
  Something has taken considerable pains to decorate this disused storeroom.
The walls are covered with a plastering of excrement and bones, to form both
patterns and shelf-like bone ledges.  Skulls leer from these shelves - human,
humanoid, dwarven, and various sorts of other creatures as well.  The floor
is a conglomerate of bones and ordure.  A large armchair and crude table of
sorts, each fashioned from bones, stand in the northwest corner.  In the
southeast corner is a heap of torn cloth, leather scraps, bits of tapestries,
and pieces of rugs.  Suddenly the pile moves, and something rises - a huge
troll!  He does not look happy at your intrusion.

decaying meat and many bones, strewn haphazardly about the place.  Some shelves
remain on the walls, and a few boxes, crates, barrels, and bales are intact,
still standing along the walls where they were placed - who knows how many
years ago!  There is nothing of value in the place.  The exit to the west 
curves again to the north after exiting the chamber.

Pearlescent Room~
  The floor here is of white marble, the walls and vaulted ceiling sheathed in
pearly alabaster.  There is a "right feel" to the place, as a place of safety
in a storm of evil.  The room is bare and clean.  A sheet of cloudy crystal
substance seems to be set into the northern portion of the east wall.  As you
look, it begins to brighten, its radiance actually lighting the room!  Two
manlike creatures with wings of snowy feathers and radiant faces, robed in
purest white, appear amidst golden tinted, cloud-like billows.  A pale blue sky
can be seen behind them.  The step through the crystal which clouds back up.
They first peer at you, and then one speaks in dulcet tones, "What are fair
and just folk such as you doing in this foul place of pain and base wickedness?"

place some filagreed lamp once hung) over a charcoal fire in a bronze bowl,
its original purpose unknown.  A large group of bugbears have now taken over
the room and now call it their home.

otyugh who's arms flail at your entry.

contain black cloth and some finished garments(cloaks, capes, kilts, etc.).
Scores of arrows, quarrels, javelins, spears, and several dozen hand weapons
are in the 10 foot by 30 foot alcove to the northeast, with most weapons in a
state of disrepair.  At the south end of the place are boxes and several huge

The Hall of Dread~
  This place is horrible and disgusting, loathsome and fearsome.  The stonework
seems leprous and mottled.  Everywhere are sculpted fungous shapes of nightmare
form and coloration.  Each column rising to the roof above writhes and squirms
with intertwined fungi.  The walls drip with slimes and ooze revolting exudation
The bizarre reds, disgusting yellows, rotten grays and browns, and other colors
blend in a vertiginous swirl in the center of the northern part of the place,
wherein squats a huge sprawling purple throne.
  The demoness must have used this area to view captives and servants, the
former going to whatever unspeakable fates awaited them, the latter exalting in
the fact that no similar prospect awaited them, as long as they served Zuggtmoy

Hall of Elemental Magic~
  This huge echoing hall is constructed of polished black stones, which give
black odd reflections of your light.  The most striking features here are the
symbols set into the chamber floor.
  To the north is a triangle of dull ecru stone, outlined with some sort of gray
metal; a throbbing radiance seems to spread in dun-colored pulses that wash over
the area.  To the east is a great 10 foot square of translucent stone, blue at
the edges and shading to a deep green at the center, bordered by a strip of pale
green; the whole gives out undulating sheets of blue-green light.  To the south
is a circle of transclucent crystal ringed by a silvery band; the whole sends
forth slowly rising clouds of pale light, that spread and disappear.  To the 
west is a long diamond shape with four points radiating from the sides of the
lozenge.  The whole is fashioned of translucent stone mottled red and amber,
outlined in red gold.  It sends up sudden tongues of brightness, planes of pale

The Hall of Dread~
  This hall is attired much like the last, with the same leprous and mottled
stonework, same sculpted fungous shapes of nightmare form and coloration, and
colums rising from the floor to the ceiling with fungous intertwined around
them.  The walls drip with slimes and ooze revolting exudations.  The bizzare
reds, disgusting yellows, rotten grays and browns, nauseous greens, and hideous
blues blend in a vertiginous swirl in the center of the northern wall, wherein
squats a huge sprawling purple throne.
  Projections resembling blighted vegetation line the walls, and each gives off
a dim but pervasive illumination.  Passages and doors are in the east and north
walls.  The floor makes a squashing, wet sound as you walk upon it, getting 
softer and softer to the north end of the hall.
  There is a throne here.

throne~

  This great chair is sculpted to display fungi and human forms, but those
depicted are shown crying out in pain as fungi shoot up from their flesh, feed
upon their dead and decomposing bodies, or grow rampant in their bony remains.
Even the shape of the throne is abominable; its seat is broad and round, with a
concave surface and four hemispherical indentations, two in front, two behind.
It has wide arm rests but no back whatsoever.  It stands upon a four-tiered
dais, the top and 2 foot high steps of which are carved in bas-relief to depict
fungi, smut, slimes, molds, jellies, and other horrible growths devouring a
compacted mass of living and dead humans.

Place of Earth and Golden Chains~
  This 30 foot by 40 foot chamber is a strange composite of polished pink stone,
golden chains, and a floor of loose earth.  Deep black earth covers the entire
floor, save for a four-foot-wide walkway which edges the room.  The bright 
metal chains hang from the walls, affixed by rings to the walkway as well. 
The room is dark; the walls show neither cressets nor sconces.

  The plastered walls of this 30 foot by 20 foot room are decorated with many
murals, depicting scenes in which humans, demihumans, and humanoids are being
robed in finery of various sorts and given crowns of gold, adorned by devices
of skulls.  Above all are paintings of a golden-skull wearing a silvery crown,
in which are set gems of red, blue-green, crystal, and orange-brown.  The floor
is tiled in black and yellow squares each a foot across.  The west wall shows
scenes of elemental devastation, and under each depiction is a chair.  Save
for cressets, the room is otherwise bare.

Hall of Merriment~
  The plastered walls here show scenes of revelry and debauchery, involving
coronated individuals similar to those in the previous chamber.  Those rewarded
in the antechamber were evidently taken here to be feted.  Couches, cushions,
and pillows surround small tables.  The place is in disorder, as if those once
here left hurriedly.  Several stands are tipped over, as are chairs; stains on
the carpets show where food and drink were spilled and never cleaned.  Dishes,
ewers, and drinking vessels lie in scattered profusion.  All of the furnishings
are of excellent workmanship and materials, but all are disgusting in what they
depict.  The walls have many cressets, and bronze candelabra and hanging lamps
are in the corners.

watered silk, eight satin ones of deep orange, and six ottomans of shining
black leather.  Wall murals and tapestries show scenes of debauchery amidst a
forest of fungi upon beds of mold and like places.  A throne-like golden seat
stands in the room's center.  One tapestry shows the round-bodied, 
elephant-legged, fungi-headed bulbous thing seated on the throne chair, amidst
a revelry of fungoid forms.

toadstool, fungus, blight, etc. - in all colors, sizes, and shapes.  Some dozen
or so larger sculptures are made of ivory, inlaid with translucent materials,
and stand on the floor, apparently for use as stools by those who wish to rest
while viewing the gallery's offerings.

nauseating green and orange figures, dominates the north wall.  Behind this
couch is a tapestry depicting the spherical creature with the mushroom neck
and head.  Before the couch are several stools of cinnabar.  All of the wood is
inlaid with mother-of-pearl, showing demons, fungi, or worse.  The wall cressets
and sconces are of bright copper, either recently attended or magically kept
polished.  Before a throne, a gold bowl contains some offerings.

hue:  a mauve carpet, lilac and puce wall hangings, even a long table with 12
chairs and a larger one at its head are lacquered violet.  Bronze candelabrea 
are on the table, and bronze wall sconces are placed at regular intervals. 
This place was probably a council chamber.  The south wall bears a large map
of Shadowdale, with the Temple at its center.  It shows the conquests of the 
Temple shaded in purple, along with dots of purple, black, red, green, white,
and brown.  Some cryptic marks are by each dot, shown by most cities and towns.

Great Hall~
  Some odd looking pillars stand flanking the first part of this large hall.
30 feet beyond the pillars, the hall broadens to 60 feet width.  A huge dais
of translucent alabaster commands the west end of the place.  Before this 
stepped platform is a magical device, set in the floor - a hexagon whose two 
interlocking equilateral triangles and the circle that rings them, seem to be
made of molten electrum.  Tips protruding from the sides of the central hexagon
glow different colors.  The center of the device pulses a pure purple light.
  Atop the dais to the west is a huge throne of silver, adorned with hundreds
of precious gems.  These are set to form leering demon faces, skulls, fungi, and
like patterns; they are of all colors, sizes, and shapes.  Behind this seat is
a huge tapestry of deep purple, worked in red, green, and ochre to show various
fungi.
  You find it difficult to see details of the west hall because it's enshrouded
in a black mist.

armor hang from each long wall, north and south; each is of black metal,
enameled with strange glyphs in pigments of red, white, green, and brown, 
surrounding a golden skull.  The armor is strangely fluted and spiked; the
helmets are wrought to give the wearer a most frightening appearance.  Each of
the four suits of armor also bears a huge two-handed sword.
  There are some frescoes here.

frescoes~
  The frescoes show crowned and robed humans, attended by demons of minor sorts
and slaves bearing rich rewards parading in triumph before a horrible bloated
figure upon a throne-like seat.  The mottled fungous body-sphere of this
creature is topped by a toadstool-like growth with a face upon it.  The body 
has four elephantine legs, but no visible arms.  Seated beside this 
abomination is an obese male demonic figure, also seated on a throne.

Earth-Floored Area~
  The whole floor of this chamber is covered with a noisome earth, soil that
contains much manure and other rotting things.  From this sickening humus
spring numerous thin-stalked fungi growths, thicker ones bearing strange caps,
spongy-looking growths, and various shelf-fungi and tumerous spherical blobs
growing from niches and shelves placed along the walls.  These latter growths,
as well as a few of those growing from the floor, give off a ghostly 
phosphorescent illumination.
  As you set foot in the place, you hear a female voice call out a warning to
"stand still!  Some of the fungi are dangerous.  I know the path, and will come
to guide you".  You see a comely head moving this way and that through the
huge fungi, evidently following a winding course through the growths.

  This circular chamber, some 40 feet in diameter, is lit by four weirdly
glowing globular cressets of ancient bronze.  The light reveals nine monstrous
statues, whose stoney visages are still sufficient to strike fear into the heart
of even the brave such as yourselves.  Beyond a smallish blue dragon is a
beholder; a fire giant, manticore, and medusa seem to stand in frozen 
conversation; and off to one side are a mummy, an ogre mage, a wight, and a
rakshasa.

shape within, the branches at the base corners and the stem meeting the apex.
The eyes are of all sorts - human and monstrous, blind-looking, multi-faceted,
and of various colors - and all seem to stare in hatred, hunger, or fright.
  The chamber has seen rather rough use of late, for there are piles of rubbish
scattered about, gnawed bones, and signs of a large fire apparently frequently
burned in the middle of the floor.  Two smoky cressets burn on the east and 
west walls, about midway between each pair of doors.

moving about the room, the haze of the room distorts the images but they 
appear to be giant rats and foxes.  The room is 20 feet by 30 feet, the ceiling,
(if there is one) is impossible to see, due to the bright light.  Blue sky and a
hot sun seem to be overhead, but the sky appears close - only 20 feet up.
  In the center of the room are some jackalweres, jackals, and gargoyles 
taunting some prisoners.  They approach the prisoners, who are armed only with
small impotent clubs, and scratch them with their sharp claws, or bite them.
Just out of reach of the prisoners is a tantalizing image for them:  a large
ring with a key in it, a dagger, a longsword, and a rod of some sort.  When 
the prisoners see you, they cry out for your aid!

Grotto~
  This circular chamber, some 40 feet in diameter and 40 feet high at the apex
of its dome, is made to appear as if it were a natural setting(albeit bleak and
disquieting).  The walls are hewn to appear as boulders, and detritus is spread
by the walls.  Jagged rocks likewise protrude from the perimeter in seemingly
natural manner.  Even in the relatively open center, the floor is uneven, with
cracks, ledges, and loose rock.
  The whole area is dimly lit by a gray light, with no apparent source but
nonetheless leaving pools of shadows near the walls.  A cold, damp breeze moans
and sighs throughout, and the air smells foul.  A bone projects from a fissure
to the east, and near it is a full skeleton clad in chain mail.  A leering skull
atop a low slab of rock to the northwest seems to taunt you.  A staircase leads

Small Jail~
  The room is 20 foot square, with some filthy straw scattered on the floor,
a small drain hole in the northwest corner, and a water-filled barrel.  Herein

Hall of Black Feasting~
  This 40 foot square room is floored in blocks of alternating red and black
stone.  The supports and ceiling are all black.  The walls are plastered and 
decorated with scenes of horrid feasts - a banquet where ghouls, ghasts, 
shadows, and vampires join Temple clerics and demons in an unspeakable repast.
The many cressets along the walls are unlit, for this place seems to have been
deserted for some time.  Several long tables, chairs, and sideboards are here,
all dusty but otherwise in good condition.  The tables still hold many dishes,
platters, drinking vessels, and containers.

Hall of Armored Skeletons~
  This 30 foot wide area is lined with disquieting guardians - or trophies.
Thirteen human skeletons stand at attention along each wall, all clad in
various forms of armor.  Each holds a different pole arm or missle weapon.
Four large bronze stands are by each wall, evidently candle holders, though
no candles remain.  Six pairs of crossed swords and six shields decorate the
north wall.

  This chamber is red.  The floor, walls, and curved ceiling are each of a 
subtly different hue, to jar the vision of the onlooker.  The overall impression
is bloody and disgusting.  Rotting cushions and divans, all of red cloth and
again each slightly different from another, are scattered here and there.  A
low round table of wood lacquered in orange-red stands near the west end of
the room; upon it is a red serving set of several cups and a bowl.  Each of
the two candelabra nearby holds 13 candle stubs.

paraphernalia typical to an alchemist's or wizard's laboratory.  On the floor
are more mundane items - a large box of chalk, sacks of charcoal, jugs of 
turpentine and fuel oil, candles of various colors, etc.  Sufficient material
seems herein to stock a small shop and supply a magic-user or two as well.

  The merest glance herein reveals the past purpose of this circular room as a
place for alchemical experimentation.  The walls and floor are covered with
graven symbols, glyphs indicating the elements, metals, and other stuff of
alchemy.  Benches and work tables line the walls; upon them are flasks, retorts,
crucibles, etc.  Three braziers, each of a different size, are aligned in the
middle of the room, piled with plates and dishes which hold heaps of strange
powders, granules, and crystals.  Beakers and flasks here and there are filled
with odd substances.  The exit to the west soon curves to the south after it

Laboratory~
  This area, 10 feet wide and 50 feet long, seems to have been meant principally
for the reading and writing of spells.
  Cressets are fitted to the walls at ten foot intervals.  A long, slanted
shelf is along the north wall, with many stools spaced along its 30 foot length.
Sheets of vellum and parchment still lie upon the shelf, accompanied on an 
upper ledge by quills of many sorts, small pots with oddly carved stoppers, and
candlesticks.  A small writing desk stands at the west end, and a lectern at
the far east.  Several small chairs are nearby, along the south wall.

Over a great fire pit(now cold) in the center of the room hang several large
chains, one of which suspends a great iron pot.  Several eye bolts are set in
the walls, to each of which is attached a 10 foot long chain.  Beside each 
door is an empty torch bracket.  Each of the four iron doors leading out of the
chamber - one at each wall - stands open.  A great heap of cloth, pillows, and
skins lies in the southwest corner, with a tun, barrel, and sack nearby.

preserved meats and cheeses - it is apparent that this kitchen is still used
occasionally.  Enough food is here to feed several score people for many days.

Opulent Bedchamber~
  This place is covered with thick carpets, with many cushions spread about.
Upon it lies the mummified body of an elf, face down just beyond the entryway
with the hilt of a dagger protruding from the back.  It remains are clad in 
rotting splendor; the garments are of silk and brocade, and the garments are of
silk and brocade, and jewels gleam from earrings, a necklace, a bracelet, and
two rings.  The skeletal right hand clutches a carved stone of some sort.
  Near the body is a large curio cabinet, its door slightly ajar.  The cabinet
contains mummified portions of human, demi-humans, and humanoids.
  The dark room has many unused candelabra and wall sconces.  Its plastered
walls are painted with scenes of decadence, and the tapestries hanging here and
there show similar scenes of depravity.  A huge bed stands against the north
wall, with a table on each side.

also seem to be of remarkable hardness.  Each sound - footfall or spoken word -
echoes alarmingly in this place.  Though two brakets for torches are mounted
on each wall(flanking the doors), all are empty.

  The secret passage leads into a 20 foot by 30 foot room where you are 
horrified - perhaps petrified - to see a huge pale green basilisk gazing at
you.
  Suddenly, a runnel of flame begins from the eastern portion of the chamber
and spreads rapidly from the center, going both north and south.  The moving
flame creates a line of brightness along the east and west walls of the place,
and then sends fiery streams into a pair of large cressets just at the corners
where the north and south passages enter the basilisk's lair.  The cressets
spring into leaping flames, illuminating the whole area.

man-catcher and several sorts of punching daggers(sprouting from metal
gauntlets, double-bladed with sharkskin crossgrips, and others).  Here are
wave-bladed knives, double-pointed knives, center-hilted knives, falchions,
and a buckler with a wicked center spike.  Barbed javelins, an array of maces
with oddly shaped heads(a wolf with an open mouth, a clenched draconian
forepaw, and others) are also here.  Furnishings include a narrow cot, a 
small stand, a table, two chairs, a bench, a stool, a bucket with lid,
a wardrobe and a weapons rack with assoted other weapons.  Dishes and 
foodstuffs are on the table and on a nearby shelf.  Several bottles are also

stool, a writing table with an oddly branched candle holder, a brazier, and
a pair of hanging lamps near the bed.  A wall cresset is in the southest
corner, opposite the bed.  A rush mat covers the plain floor.  A parchment with
runes hangs on the east wall; another, on the south wall opposite the 
entrance, seems to be a map of the dungeon level.

magical apparatus.  To the north, a workbench runs about 15 feet along the
wall near the door.  The wall here is lined in shelves, with all sorts of bins
and containers.  Over a small fireplace hang several kettles; a brazier, furnace
and bellows are nearby.  Along the south wall is a high writing desk, flanked
by a pair of bookstands, each with an unopened tome.
  At the far end of the room are a table, high-backed chair, and an open
cabinet.  Upon the table are a green cup, an iron box, a scattering of gems,
several potion bottles, and a leather case.  The cabinet holds three iron
coffers, a crystal ball, a tall pointed black hat, a box of reddish wood, a
long brass wand, five large books, and a small ceramic statuette.

unknown causes.  The remains obviously harbor no treasure.  A vague feeling of
unease creeps over all who gaze into this place of darkness overlong.  The
place is empty, except for a black iron coffin by the northwest wall; its iron
lid, in which a silver cross has been inlaid, lies beside it.  After a little
searching, you discover a sarcophagus with no top.  You see a vampire, clad in
black and appearing hale lying within.  As you watch, he starts to move.

Private Room~
  This chamber is truly impressive.  The floor is covered with thick rugs, the
walls are inlaid with tapestries of ornate geometric designs, involving circles,
squares, triangles, and the eight-pointed fire symbol.
  Two engraved braziers shed light and heat from the western corners of the
room, and a large fireplace in the east wall adds its radiance.  By the latter
are brass andirons and matching fireplace tools.  Atop a marble mantelpiece are
several knicknacks, and hanging on the wall above them is an excellent painting.
The latter depicts the united forces of the Greater Temple in full battle garb
standing before the great altar, with their human leaders before them.
  All around the room are bookshelves, a few tables, and a truly massive bed
in the center of the room piled high with rich sheets and blankets.

  This room is filled with crates, barrels, boxes, and the like.  The boxes and

East Wing~
  The walls of this room are covered by a huge tapestry which depicts a great
battle, apparently between the forces of Good and Evil.  Therein, shining humans
and winged humanoids are being blasted to the ground by magical rays issuing
forth from the eyes of a gigantic, rotund, wrinkled face.  Other than the
tapestry...and the four trolls who snarl at your approach, the room is empty.

Study~
  The east wall of this room is dominated by a great brick fireplace with marble
mantle, upon which are various knickknacks - shrunken human heads, religous
paraphernalia, carved figurines, and other interesting items.
  Decorative tapestries flank the fireplace on the east wall.  They depict a
large battle between the forces of Good and Evil, where large demons are ripping
some human paladins apart with their claws.  A larger demon than the other 
stands watching, with a totally evil grin on his face.

  This is a small, cramped passageway.  You have to keep your head bent

  The room is well-appointed, with tapestries on the walls and furnishings made
of ebony and rosewood.  The bed stands in the southeast corner, adjacent to a
small fireplace in the east wall.  A wardrobe stands at the foot of the bed
between it and the door.  The north wall is filled by a long workbench, with
beakers bubbling over small flames, bottles and boxes of various rare
substances, and other laboratory paraphernalia.  On the west wall is an oaken
shelf unit, upon which are three large and heavily bound books, a group of
twelve pieces of assorted skulls, and two small medallions.

room is a huge cauldron and a small fire burning underneath it.  A large bugbear
is currently stiring the mixture in the pot and several other bugbears stand
around waiting to eat.

The Greater Temple~
  You stand in a large hall with a raised altar to the northern section of the
hall.  The ceiling rises up a full sixty feet above you, flanked by buttresses
with a statue of a gargoyle scowling down upon you.  The walls are lined in
smoth black marble or onyx, of such fine craftmanship that the joints are 
barely visible.  On the ceiling can be seen dots depicting the stars and 
constellations.
  Draped across the altar is a sheet of red silk, with the eight-pointed fire
symbol embroidered upon it in golden thread.  Situated behind the altar is a 
curtain depicting the same symbol.
  To your west and east, the hall continues, forming a U, with the open area
towards the north.

up to a height that is not visible.  On the ceiling can be seen many small dots
that you notice look like the constellations.  Also on the walls, about 50 feet
about the floor, are some buttresses with statues of gargoyles on them.  Two 
trolls stand about this room guarding it from folks like yourself.
  There are five exits from this room, one of which leads back to the main
part of the hall to the east.

Foyer~
  The green corridor to the south suddenly opens into a wide ceremonial area.
The walls bear the same decoration, of water creatures amidst a chaotic sea of
square and rectangular symbols.  The ceiling is painted to resemble the view
upwards from under water, the surface swirls and eddies reflecting light from
above.  Two large ceremonial urns stand in the north corners of the room.  A
doorway in the center of the north wall is 10 feet wide and 15 feet high, and
opens into a sunken pool area to the north.  A short stair, only 5 feet wide,
leads down into the pool through the doorway.

Lounge~
  Four walls cressets send smoky light through this room.  The place is 
plastered, the floor covered with mosaic tiles.  The paintings on the walls
display scenes indicating that this room was meant for drinking and debauching
(though whether for the clerics of the Temple or its guests remains uncertain)
Eight double bunks are here.  A long and well-made table in the middle of the
room is flanked by long benches, plus a chair at each end.  Cloaks on pegs are
apparent, as are chest under the bunks.  Three barrels stand just inside the
south door, two containing liquids and the other some lumpy objects.  Several
large smoked sausages hang from a rope tossed over a ceiling truss.  A small
cabinet between the bunks on the east wall holds dishes.

   like an immortal. Unless there is a code problem, or something that would
   require you to act different. Immortals must keep thier distance from
   mortals.

Starlight's Forest Sanctuary~
  You find yourself standing in the middle of a gigantic forest.  Small
trails and pathways wind their way into the woods.  Overhead, weak beams
of sunlight shine through the thick canopy of leaves.  Off in the distance
you hear the sounds of splashing water and decide to investigate.
  An obscure little trail leads you into the middle of a clearing
surrounded by several ancient oak trees.  A tiny stream ends here, forming
a crystal clear pool of water.  At the waters edge sits Starlight, 
dangling her feet in the water and stroking the fur of a black cat that's
curled up in her arms.  As you enter the clearing, the cat looks up at you
with wise golden-green eyes, studies you for a moment, then goes back to
watching the fish.

pool~
  You edge closer to the pool of water, trying not to disturb Starlight.
As you reach the edge and peer into it, you can see all of Shadowdale as
if you were thousands of feet up in the air.  As you concentrate on the
picture, it begins to zoom in on a small patch of forest in a part of 
the world you've never seen before.  The picture has finally zoomed in 
far enough that you can make out two tiny figures sitting by the side
of a small pool of water.  One of the figures is sitting by the edge of
the pool and the other is knelt down beside it peering down into it.
You realize with a start that the picture is of you from above!  Your
concentration broken, the image disappears in a wave of ripples leaving 
an ordinary pool of water...

Instruction Room for Jail~
      This is the room where you figure out how to use the Jails.
The time a person must spend in jail is as follows:
You must be of an editing level to set the duration of the room.
This is done by editing the teleport function of the room.
The formula is as follows.

edit tele <time> 3001 1
time is set as follows:
300 = 1 tick
the duration of the sentence doubles with the offense.
It starts at 4 ticks. Such that first offense is 4 ticks,
second eight, third sixteen, etc.
For a 3 offense the time would be: 16 * 300 = 4800

The fine a person gets is as follows:
        10% of gold carried and or in bank, depending on which
        you can tell.
        Take the best weapon the person has away from them.

        And you fine them a number of items equal to one less than
        the offense.
Example:
If this is a person's fourth offense they get fined as follows:
40% of their gold is taken (round up)
The person's best weapon is taken
The person looses their 3 best items.

furnished with a peg, pallet, and a pail.  The tiny windows on the front of
the cells are barred from this side and the doors are likewise bound with a
heavy metal bar.  None of the cells are currently occupied, but some of them
contain clerical paraphenalia so you believe that the cells are also sleeping
quarters for the acolytes.

  You are standing on a large plain.  The horizon fades off farther than your
petty eyes can see.  In every direction is the same, dirt.  There are all
types of dirt under you - loose dirt, packed dirt, clay, stony earth, etc.
The only relief from the same flat earth is the occassional hill, or tunnels
leading to god knows where.  There are paths leading in all directions, but to
where they lead you can only guess.

  You are in a tunnel that was burrowed into the side of a hill.  The sides
of the tunnel are in some spots granite, in others dirt, and yet in other 
spots, being made of some other material.  The effect is rather strange.  A
low rumbling is coming from the west, from what manner of creature you can not
fathom.  You could always go east also, towards the light.

various kinds, some normal, others semi-precious.  To your east is a cave of

the path continues.

You look in vain for an exit, running this way and that, but the walls just 
recede from in front of you, and draw towards you from behind.  Even burrowing
into the lose soil at your feet is futile as the roof just comes down to meet
your efforts.  Now, how do you cast that astral spell...

  You stand on the side of a large hill.  A hole extends into the ground below
you.  Above you, the hill continues at a grade that is too steep for you to 
climb.  You fear to try and fly up also, for there is a large horde of rather
large birds that swoop down upon anything airborne here, quickly stripping
and tearing up all that flies around here which is not another bird.

Plane of Water~
  You stand in a room submerged by water.  The room is filled with very salty
water that hums with the energy from the two portals in the room, one on the
north wall that is opaque and another on the east wall which is various shades
of red and bubbles and makes an audible hiss spread through the water.  On the
south wall is growing some sort of aquatic plant with a large, broad trunk. 
In the face of the trunk is a keyhole.  To the west is the 'ocean' from which
you came.

some crystaline material that you have never seen before.  In the center of 
the portal is a large keyhole.  The strange thing about this portal is, you
can look right through it!  It appears to go no where!  To the west is a portal
of some sort which is a strange bluish-green color.

tree~
  An oak tree taller than any other tree here towers above you.  On one
of the lower branches lounges a red and white striped cat.  Noticing the
sudden attention you're giving it, the Cheshire Cat grins at you and
slowly fades out of existence piece by piece until all that's left is
a set of grinning white teeth.  After a few moments, these too disappear

pool~

notice that several hours have gone by.

Stic's Chamber of War~
  You find yourself deep in an underground bunker illuminated by a single
red lightbulb dangling from the celing.  Occasionally there will be a
loud THUMP! and plaster chunks fall from the celing and break on the floor
into little white clouds of dust.  Somewhere towards the back of the room
you see a shadow of movement.  Peering closer into the shadows you can
make out a large desk with a figure behind it.  Suddenly the desk lights
up with a pale yellow glow, illuminating the figure behind it.  Stic
cackles insanely as he moves a little figure across a large sheet of
parchment.  As you watch the figure explodes into a miniature ball of 
fire, leaving nothing behind but a smoking corpse.  Stic looks up at you
and grins evilly.

still make out the likeness of on old man you seem to recognize. He has a 
white beard and very wise, forgiving eyes that seem to pierce you soul. You
almost notice a tear in his eye. Below the painting is a book or rather what
once was a registry. To the north you may leave the church, or to the east
you may visit the classrooms of ATOR. Or to the South you may visit the grand
cathedral.

here. It is now very quiet and you know at one time this room must have lead
to a pleasing, musical place that called all surrounding Shadowdale patrons
to their church. Up is the top of the Belltower and to the west is another
exit to this now deserted room.

The Top of the Belltower~
You struggle to reach this room as it has been a long climb. There is a large
bell here, still intact. The room amazingly is undamaged and your heartbeat
quickens as you realize that there still is a place in the church untouched
by evil. The windows here overlook the massive orchard that looks like a 
warzone, and beyond you see the graveyard. The feeling of dread returns as 
you are aware that you must past these places to return to your home. Looking
closer at the bell you notice the intricate, ornate carvings and are overcome
with grief at the realization of all the wonderous things in the church that
must have been destroyed. The only exit is down.

The small crypt~
You find what dug the hole. The wight decided the graveyard just wasn't good
enough for him and he had to have a better home than what the living could
have made for him. The small crypt smells terrible and is small even for
something that is dead! You could always just leave back up.

Back of the Church~
As you enter this room you get a full realization of how large and intricate
the cathedral really is - or was. All around you are excrements and vile 
smelling pools of slime. The pews of the church at ripped and beat to small
bits of timber and ripped cloth. You begin to notice skeletons and half
rotted cadavers. There is a stench that is apparently stronger further inside
the church. Very little light filters in from the broken stained glass windows.
There are exits to the south, east, and west. There is always the way back to
the foyer to the north.

You are in the right side of the back of the church. The stench is strong.
There is a corpse here hacked to pieces by the conquerors of the church. You
just hope there are not others that met the same fate but your sixth sense
tells you otherwise. A little light filters in through the window here that 
has been shattered and is lying in small pieces of glass on the floor. You
can exit to the west.

Middle Row of Pews~
You stand in the very center of the massive cathedral. The light here is very
weak, but can see the ceiling which towers several meters above your head. The
timbers holding the church upright are huge and ornately carved and appear to
have been assembled a long time ago to stand up to the passing times. The floor
is polished oak that was built by hands of caring. The pews here appear to be
made of the same strong oak while the velvet cushions are ripped to shreds.
The stench is very strong and you think you may really loose your lunch before
you can find your way to the next rooms. There are exits to the north, east,
south, and west.

little light filters through - the church is overgrown with vines and thorn
bushes essentially covering all the windows. The smell is strong and you wish
you were back in the safety of Shadowdale. There is an exit to the west.

destruction that has been brought to bear here is even more so. The pews are
ripped and charred and the velvet cushions are in small shreds and scattered.
There are many humanoid corpses that have been stabbed and hacked repeatedly.
The lighting is faint however you notice a small glow the comes from atop 
the altar. The glow seems to give you hope and you have a strange feeling
to move forward toward the altar. There are exits north and south.

The Altar of ATOR~
Here is the altar of ATOR. The altar itself is hacked, broken, charred, 
severely desecrated. The marble the altar was made of has broken off into
chunks and fallen onto the floor. The stench here is more overpowering than
ever before and you choke to breathe. But what is most amazing is the 
statue that stands upon the altar. The statue is of the likeness of the old
man you saw in the picture in the foyer. The statue glows with a faint light
and has been obviously untouched. As you move you hand to touch the statue
a voice in your mind forces you to withdraw. You can readily see what has kept
this statue free from all harm - the blessings of the god himself. You begin 
to realize that whatever protects this statue may reward you for defeating 
the evil that conquered this holy place.
There are exits to the north, east, south, and west.

Standing before you is a massive organ. The organ is still impressive despite
the pounding it has taken at the hands of the intruders. Finely polished and
ingraved wood are meticulous in construction as the organ surrounds itself
on three sides the organ player. The keyboards are multi-leveled and the 
footpedals are multi tiered. The pipes are most impressive as the surround and 
blend into the walls around this immense room. However sitting at the organ
appears to be your worst nightmare.

any dead church members. You are very puzzled what this may mean. The

apparent that whoever planned the attack dispatched a great many warriors
to sacrifice themselves, so others behind them may be succesful. The smells

destroy it but to capture the old man. And the attackers that gathered here
had this as there goal. These attackers must have been very grim and determined
and you now know they were succesful.

Narrow Ledge~
As you move toward the ledge you can see that there appears to be no bottom.
It would be dangerous to try to levitate over the cavern and try to find an
exit further north even though there might be one. There is not much room
to manuever here and there is always the way back south.

crawlspace an earthquake takes place closing off the exit west. You have a
distinct feeling that this was not a random event. There is now only an

his eyes. He motions toward the exit and drops a key here. He says to take
his earthly posessions as he should know go meet his GOD and atone for his
failures. He then utters a few words and disappears in a fine mist. A deep
resonant bell rings - the sound coming from the exit.

Broken Down Tunnel~
You stand in a small dirt tunnel.  Rotting wooden rafters
support the ceiling.  The rafters look as if they could go at any
minute. A broken wheel barrow and a rusted pick lie near the edge
of the wall.  It look as if at some point this tunnel was being
mined out of.

issue forth a loud GROAN as dust and dirt begins to spew forth
from the ceiling, completely clouding your vision.  In desperation

Unfortunatly you were not quick enough.  With a loud CRACK and final
GROAN the rafters give completly away.  You are knocked to the ground
as tons of earth come raining down upon you.  Within seconds you
feel your rib cage giving and it becomes hard to breathe.  Inky 
blackness soon overcomes you and you pass into a kinder more gentle

You stand in a small, dark tunnel that leads north and south.  Far

Further to the north an over powering sensation of evil washes

red and white tabbards bearing a cross over a tree of some sort.  
You can see clearly the look of terror and fear in their face
and you get a strong feeling that there spirits never passed on

throughout the room are tables, most filled with pigmies taking a break from
their hard days work.  Straight ahead of you, to the north, you see the bar.
To the east you see some stairs leading up.  Nestled off to the west you see
a table hidden even further in the shadows that contains a pigmy that looks
different than others.  He is a little larger than most and wears armor that
looks well crafted.

around here for the lack of it that you have seen.  It's surface is stained
with various liquids, scorch marks from past small blazes, and nicks and cuts
where the patrons have been less than careful with their tools of trade.
The patrons move aside slowly as you approach the bar, but not before they
glare at you and mumble a few words under their breath.  The bartender puts
down the mug he was wiping with a not to clean rag and says something to you
in a tounge that you are not familiar with.

Row of Benches on the East Side~
  You are standing in front a set of benches that are presently occupied
by pigmies who are attending the worship service.  They seem oblivious to 
your presense, instead being totally entralled with what the cleric is saying
to the assembled.  On the wall to the east is a picture depicting the pigmies
triumph over a group on gnomes.

Row of Benches on the West Side~
  Seated on the low bench here is a group of pigmies in various states of
devotion, ranging from total devotion to outright boredom.  To the east is
the altar from which you came.

Temple Altar~
  In the center of this room is a really vile altar, covered with dry
blood from the numerous sacrifices to the god of these pigmies.  You look
in disgust and you notice not a few of the pools of blood are not totally
dry yet.  A cleric stands here ready for the next sacrifice.  When you 
approach the altar, he moves in front of the altar and pulls a big knife
out, ready to defend his altar to the death.  Off to the west and east are
pews where the devoted sit and watch the sacrifices with a bloodlust you 
thought lost from this world.

You stand in a long hallway lit with torches.  The hallway is made of stone
and smells of mold and dampness.  The air is oppresive and a bit hot.  
Farther ahead you notice that the hallway curves to the east contiuning
on. There is also a ladder in this room that leads up above into the 
church the pigmys use.

Turn in the Hallway~
You stand in a hallway lit by smoldering torches.  You find it slighly hard
to breath due to all the smoke the torches produce.   To your west the hallway
curves around and to the south the hallway continues.  To the north
you see a wooden door.  From the north you are able to smell the aromas of
food!

A High Priest's Antechambers~
This room is rather large and well lit by a mixature of torches and candles.
A large bed with a matress made of straw and cloth lies against the 
northern wall.  A desk carved of the finest oak sits on the western wall 
facing the door, behinde the desk is a large chair made of wood and leather.
The leather has a funny look to it.  In front of the desk are two smaller
chairs made of wood and a fine cloth.  There is also a small wooden table 
with several chairs surrounding it, atop it are several plates with
a few crumbs on them.  On the southern wall is a large tapestry that bears
symbolds much like the symbols you saw on the door.

  This room is a hive of activity.  Everywhere you look is a stove with a
large pot or caldron on top of it.  There is a pigmy here who runs this way
and that way testing one pot and then another, occasionally stopping to pour
some liquid or powder from one of many vials that he has lining the walls.
He looks very busy and wouldn't like any interruptions.  You think that you
had better leave.

  You have entered what is apparently the cook's room.  Stacked up on the
shelf on the wall are cookbooks from all over the land.  Reading the titles,
one catches your eye.  It's title is "100 ways to cook Gnome."  Makes you 
wonder if pigmies don't like Gnomes very much.  Other than that, there is
a rather crude bed in the back of the room, and a desk against the other 
wall.  The only exit is back through the kitchen.

An Un-Holy Altar~
  And you thought the altar upstairs was bad.  This one's vileness far
surpasses the horror you saw there.  This altar is made of some black stone
that seems to swallow the meager light that fills the room.  You feel waves
of evil and hatred come off the altar.  Lying atop the altar is a mutilated
corpse that you think to be gnome, but you can't be too sure.  At closer
inspection, you notice that a few organs are missing from the corpse but
they are no were to be seen.  You feel that you had better leave before the
worshippers of such an altar come back.

there is a rather long fall to the bottom of the mountain.  To the east
the path continues around the mountain and to the North the path leads to
some sort of  building that was built in the mountain.

Just as you make up your mind on what direction to take you hear a 
horrifying cry of pain come from the south.

these pigmys wear a look of grim determination on their face instead of

the finger bones even looks rather large like it might have belonged

On the northeren edge of the platform lies a large aspen tree trunk,
probably coming from the patches of aspen that grow on the mountain.  
The trunk is marred and pock marked with axe bites and stained with
blood. About this time you notice the large brute of a pigmy standing
in the corner with his large axe.  Little is left to your imagination
as to the purpose of the pigmy or the room.

Stepping into this room you almost immediatly regret it.  It is painfuly 
obvious that this room is the torture chamber used by the pigmys.  The
air in the room is sour and stale, it smells of fear, blood and death.
Arranged in the room are numerous torture devices.  You recognize a
few of them such as the rack where a prisoner is currently being pulled
apart by his arms and feet.  The boot where a young girls foot is being
crushed as she screams and crys for mercy.  You also notice an iron maiden,
a cauldron of buring oil, a table filled with odd shaped corck screws,
pliers, forks, and branding irons.  Opposite the table is a large wooden
platformm, several nails protude from the platform where they were used
to nail the feet of pigmy to it.  The entire room is covered in 
blood and other bodily fluids.  Screams and crys of agony, anguish
and pain escape from the few prisoners here.

BlackSmith's Cave~
This cave is rather large and is filled with the smell of fire and hot
metal. Four small ovens used for heating metal line the north wall.  
Ontop of each oven is vent that leads through the ceiling and mountain
top to the fresh air outside.  In the center of the room are three anvils
of differing size but all look to be heavy and sturdy.  The walls are lined
with all types of tools used in the crafting of armor, weapons, and metal
parts. In the center of the room is a rather stout pigmy who holds a large
hammer in his hand and is furiously poudning away at a piece of metal.
To his left is a smaller pigmy who holds the metal on the anvil with
a large pair of pliers.

of clothes.  Two unlite torches are located on the north and south wall

At the end of this ten foot long passage is what is obviously the back
of a secret door.  Constructed to look as if it were part of the wall to
those on the other side, no attempt has been made to disquise the
presence of the door from this side.  Light from the other side 
faintly outlines the door, and there is a handle to pull the door open.

wall and held in place by a rope fastened to a pin.  Another rope is
connected to this and pin and runs foward along the wall to a hook set in
the wall.  This hook is about the same place where the bar would

The east wall is different from the others.  It shows signs of recent
constructionand upkeep as it is patched in several places.  On the whole
this wall appears to be stoutly built.

Collapsed Guard Room~
The wooden door to this room is charred with several boards missing and
other planks obviously weakened.  The handles, hinges, and other metal
fittings are half-melted, soundly jamming the door shut.  The room
beyond, as seen through the holes, is severly burnt, its furnashings buried
and ruined beyond recognition.  The ceiling has collapsed for the most
part, revealing another chamber on the second floor.  About five feet
of the ceiling still remains around the walls of the room, forming a narrow
jagged ledge.  The floor is littered with beams, plaster, ash, and
unkown other pieces of junk.  The air is filled with the odor of rot.

Treacherous Floor~
At the top of the stairs are the remains of a door, beyond which is a room.
The floor here is almost entirely gutted as is the floor below.  Thirty
feet below is the gray stone of the cellar floor.  There is an open doorway
on the opposite side of the room on this level.  Any exits from the first
floor or the cellar have been completely filled with rubble.  There are
three possible ways to walk across the space - a charred and crumbling section
of floor clings to the left wall, a narrow pathway of fallen beams 
stretches across the center like a bridge, and a sounder section of floor,
only burned at the edge, runs along the right wall.  All three paths are
accessible from this and and lead to the doorway on the opposite side.

rags. Many flies buzz about the room and the air has a sweet honey

Stable~
This wooden building is in good condition.  In it is a row of stalls for 
horses, three of which are occupied at the moment.  Tack hangs from the
walls and three saddles are piled near the double doors.  Piles of hay
line the walls opposite the stairs and several open sacks of grain
are beside them.  Four humans are sitting on the sacks, their short swords
thrust into the hay beside them.  A ladder near the single door leads
to a loft.

Stonecutter's Shed~
This ramshackle building is cluttered with a variety of tolls and junk.
There are hammers, chisels, axe handles, slabs of stone, and warped boards.
The walls are covered with many different types of holy symbols.
some o fevil and some of good religions.  Most of these look as if
they have been pegged or nailed in place.  Crouched around in a dim
and sputtering lantern are six orcs, nervously fingering their
halberds and glacning about.

Cemetery~
This open area was obviously once the cemetery for the temple compound.  Now
it is overgrown with weeds, gnarled bushes, and dying trees.  Stone markers
and small crypts can be seen at some points through the overgrowth. Paths
twist through the cemetery and some show signs of recent use.  
Everything seems gray in color here - the grass is green-gray, the soil
dusty gray, the stone markers brown and gray.  A feeling of oppression
hangs over the entire cemetery.

Inner Courtyard~
This large courtyard is mostly dust and grass.  Although several large trees
grow at one end.  Near the edges of the yard are large blocks that have
tumbled from the walls of the temple and its out-buildings.  These runied
areas look like they will provide adquate cover for any creature of man 
size or smaller that wishes to hide in them.

Basilik's Den~
There are no vible doors to this area
in fact openings that might once
have been windows or colapses in the wall have been repaired and maintained.
Now there is a wall facing the inner courtyard that stands 
about ten feet high.  Inside this area is the ruin of a collapsed building.
Several of the inner walls stand, broken, and irregular at their tops,
but there are no floors or ceilings anywhere inside the walls of
this area.  Along the wall near the outer edge of the compound are a
large number of chipped, cracked, and broken statues.  These are in
many different poses: people crouching, kneelings, praying,
defiant or twisted into broken positions.  They are all of exquisite 
workmanship and may have once been part of the furnishings of the 
previous temple.

Burnt Dormitory~
This room is charred and burnt, and in a state of collapsed
ruin. Although the walls are still intact, the ceiling has fallen in at
several places.  Fallen beams have crushed bunks and the tattered
remains of blankets show under the ashes and plaster.  Several small 
beetles and spiders scuttle from place to place, leaving tracks in the 
muddy ash.

Slaver's Lair~
The walls of this chamber are linked with twenty human slaves, their ankles
and wrists shackled and manacled together.  On the same wall as the door
can be seen the shadow of a large ogre-like figure brandishing a whip.
Gutteral commands and pitful screams can be heard.  At each crack of the 
whip the slaves cringe and cower.  A trap door is set in the floor at the
far end of the narrow room.

Cloister Garden~
Though choked with weeds and untended, this garden looks almost pleasant.  
Bright flowers bloom in many places - yellows, violets, reds, blues
and many other colors.  A path goes straight through the center to the 
door on the other side and it shows signs of recent use.  The trees are
blighted and dying, twisted boles and bare branches.  Perched in the
trees are four harpies.

Flowers and trees have been smashed into the ground and lawn benches
thrown through walls. A large marble fountain in the center of the
courtyard still stands, though, defying any attempts to destroy its
beauty. Above stands the reminants of one of the watchtowers. Archways

along with the steady flicker of the flames.  A warm fireplace has situated

generous area of fur rug.  A bottle of the best Chardonnay rests along in the
ice bucket with the two glasses.  This seems to be a very private and special

Twas like thunder -- all through the night
And a promise to see Jesus in the morning light
Love say, 'Take my hand it'll be alright..come on save your soul tonight.'
Love -- nobody know just how it was born
Love -- came to me with the radio on
Jumped up in my body with an attitude
Kissed me on the mouth and said, 'You leader take me to.'
Love's kiss was running all though my veins
The bed started shaking, I don't know who to blame
Me or this flower right in front of my eyes
Is this my sweet savior or the devil in disguise?

To let you know that I love you.
Sweet Little Rose
Let your petals sway
All your lonely days
In the wind of my heart-
I can help you see
What it's like to be
Taken from the cold
And where you grew up with me.
I can set you free
If your'll just run to me...
All the thorns will go away
If you'll stay with me

the corners of the room. Covering every wall are maps of varying countries.
Seated at a long table in the center of the room is a tall uniformed individual,who stands and looks at you wearily, as if pleased at your intrusion to  give
him a reprive from the rigors of waging warfare.

Haag's Throne Room~
     This grand hall dwarfs many of the castles you have seen.  Marble
columns as thick as a man is tall stretch up to meet a ceiling that seems
to crowd the stars.  A reflecting pool in the floor shows scenes too
horrific to be anything but hell itself, and you find yourself avoiding the
pool reflexively.  Doorways of a relatively normal size (for Haag that is)
on the East and West walls seem to shimmer and dance as if they were weak
spots in the fabric of space-time.  Circling the pool is a majestic spiral
staircase wide enough for a dozen men to walk abreast; it seems to lead up
right out of the world.  The most striking aspect of the room, however, is
the great throne of gold at its northern end.  Up on a dais sits a throne
that looks older than time itself, and sitting upon it is Mighty Haag,
the immortal Ard-righ of all Prydain.  The High-king watches you cooly.

castle.  High, unbreached walls of granite and majestic towers of gold
characterize this imposing fortress, which can only be the legendary
Camelot.  A stout drawbridge, down at the moment, offers entrance to the
gatehouse, where you see occasional flashes of Arthur's white and gold
liveried guards. To the west you see flashes of bright colors and hear
the merriment echoing from a visiting fair.

tempting smells of a fine meal in preparation waft in from the west.
You could almost swear that you hear praying through the door to the east.
The hallway continues both to the north and south.

thief~

You open the book to the page on thieves and it says:

Thieves are a group of people who have an overwhelming urge to possess items
that are not thiers.  If you run into a thief you might notice that you have
a lighter load to carry around, since some of your items or gold is missing.
However this also means that if you kill a thief he will have quite a bit of
money on him, making him a sought after person.  Thieves have the ability to
hide in the shadows also which makes finding him a bit harder.

Shrine of Brennan~
Your weapons instantly fly to your hands as you enter here.  The
feeling of impending violence is staggering.  The scent of fresh blood
reaches your nostrils, and the screams of the dying, your ears. 
The well known clash of arms fills this place yet there is no
one here.  You glance around warily as you enter further.
Yet you see nothing but a great shield on the east wall.
Looking closely at it, you see a tremendous warrior standing
tall and strong on the battlefield.  Such incredible skill could
belong to no mortal, nay this can only be Brennan, the god of war.
And in truth looking on this shield, you see he could be
at home no where but the battlefield.

Shrine of Scream~
This is not what you expected to see, in a shrine to a god.
On one wall is a bookshelf with tomes haphazardly shoved in,
across from it is a large overstuffed couch.  A large red cloak
with an "S" on it lays tossed over the rail of the stairway.
Wondering if it is magical you reach out to pick it up, and
recieve a nasty shock.  (Maybe that is why it is still there . . .)
Strangest of all is a strange item shoved off in one corner.
It looks like a beat up box of some foreign material, with a piece
of glass set in the front side.  Below and in front of it, sits
a strange board with numerous raised bumps all about it.  You
begin to reach for it, then you remember the lesson of the cloak
and quickly jerk your hand back.  As you do so, a strange light fills
the box with the glass and you see a picture form. It is Scream!
Sitting in a massive throne he gazes at you calmly and you sense
the awesome wisdom of one of the elder gods.  In his right hand
the mortal realm sits safely, ever under Screams watchful eye.
In his left he holds a massive book filled with the secrets of
the universe.  You cannot help but respect this god.

Shrine of Sarge~
Something about this room comforts you.  It is . . . laid back
for lack of a better way to say it.  A strange table sits in the
center of the room.  A raised ridge rings the edge, at each
of the four corners is a small hole, as well as midpoint on
either side of the longer pair of raised edges.  The light is dim
and a smoky haze hangs in a cloud near the ceiling.
In an elaborate painting on the west wall you see Sarge, first
of the mortal gods, relaxing in a tavern.  In one hand he
has a large mug of ale, in the other a smoke.  Drapped about him
are several women of astonishing beauty in various stages of
undress.  His smile pulls at you and it is all you can do
to keep from trying to leap into the painting to join him.

As you enter this room, stress and worry fall away leaving you
feeling refreshed and filled with a strange vitality.  All about
you lovely flowers fill the room with their heady scent.
On the east wall flows a waterfall as smooth as glass.  If falls
into a crystal clear pool with a soft trickling sound.  As 
you stare into the water, images begin to form.  A woman smiles
down at you.  It is the Lady Sarc herself, a goddess of matchless
beauty and grace.  You feel an overwhelming love for her and can
hardly restrain yourself from leaping into the water to stand
at her side.

Shrine of Ator~
All thoughts of violence fade as you come into this shrine of
meditation and peace.  No place of battle this, but of knowledge
and history.  Everything here is incalcuably ancient, and taken
care of with great love.  Incredible maps of places you have never
heard of fill the walls, while ancient tomes filled with things
far beyond your mortal comprehension line the many shelves.  The
vast intellect of a being capable of understanding this litterally
staggers your mind.
A desk sits in the center of the room, on it lies a massive book.
The writing is in an unfamiliar toungue but the pictures are
bold and vivid.  One in particular catches your eye.  A wizened
old man stands beside a hurt and wounded soul, who lies bleeding
on the ground.  As you watch the picture begins to move!  He
bends down and touches the injured man, and as he does, his hand
glows briefly and the wounds vanish!  He then turns, and looks you
straight in the eye.  An unguessed at strength lies within his
ageless eyes, but also the vast wisdom and understanding of the
elder gods.  You know without a doubt, this can be no other, than
Ator himself.

You walk in boldly, an invincible adventurer, but then you stop.
The energies playing about this room make your hair stand on 
end.  There is a feeling of barely restrained power here, and you
begin to think you are not quite so mighty as you once assumed.
The word "Zoombi" echoes through the room, softly at first, then
every so often it will thunder in you ears!  "ZOOMBI! ZOOMBI!
IT BEGAN IN AFRICA!!!!"
On the west wall, a shimmering portal of magical energy begins
to take on a life of its own.  It forms into an image of a dark
and sinister god.  IT IS NARIL!  THE GOD OF ZOOMBI!  Power flows
from him and wraps about you.  He looks at you with a calculating
gaze then begins to chuckle unnervingly.  Muahahahahahaha . . . 
Then! With a sudden gesture, he hurls flaming meteors at you!!!!
You begin to flee in terror before you realize that it is jus
an illusion.

Shrine of Immort~
You are surrounded by a holy light as you enter this room.
The light radiates from the crystal walls bathing you in its
awesome power.  The dirt on your body vanishes, your armor begins
to shine, and you gaze around with a sharpness of vision unlike
anything that you have ever known.  All about you statues of glowing
crystal stand in martial poses, as if daring the forces of darkness
to challenge their might.
In the center of the room floats a ball of light that draws
your eyes and quickens your pulse.  Within its depths, you see
the mighty Lord Immort standing in mortal combat with the combined
poewrs of evil and darkness arrayed against him.  Behind him,
in safety, rests the mortal realm, which he valiantly protects.
You are so overcome with the power of images, you fall to your
knees in worship.

A ornate marble hallway~
As you enter the the hallway, you are virtually amazed of the tapestries
of death and sorrow. They are the pictures of war that many a brave      
adventurer has faced in his lifetime. Other than the fearsome tapestries,
the hallway is nicely structured with four huge marble pillars supporting it.
As you gaze in awe you notice rooms to the north and south. To the south you
see visions of pillaging and war, and to the north there is a smell of weapon
grease and armor rust. Other than that you can always travel down the hallway
and see other exhibits.

Eventually you notice that all these swords and armors belonged to the powerful
warrior Loki. North of the wall you see a huge floor to ceiling painting of
Loki, clad in heavy armor riding on a dragon above a dark ebony tower of evil.
You are truly amazed as you know that this god has been through many battles
and victories to achieve such a high level on immortality.

As you enter the room you feel the need to hunt and kill. You notice some crude
weapons hanging on the wall, which do not appeal to you. But later you find out
that in the hands of Alun, anything can be conquered! On the far north of the
wall you see a tapestry of a 8 foot half-giant which is Alun who is fending off
a huge purple creature like a worm, and with that size of a house. It may seem
like a impossible victory but for a barbarian like him, he never learned the
meaning of impossible! Also you see skins of many creatures lining the walls,
which shows the power and the unstoppable force this barbarian emanates.

forboding as you walk towards it to get a better view. To the west you see
nothing but darkness and have a feeling of silence brought open you. Other than
that there is a spiraling stairwell which goes up.

Room of Arion the Noble One~
Upon entering the room, you have a feeling of goodness and purity washed over
you and see a white aura forming around you. You have entered a room where
Honour and Nobility resides, a place where all evil shall cring in terror as it
gets burned by the cleansing light shining from a pure white marble statue of
Arion himself in the northern end of the room. The statue is a very magnificent
sight indeed. As you gaze upon the mighty figure you feel a rush of power
flowing from it which no mortal can touch without destroying themselves.
Wielded in one hand of the statue is the mighty sword of kings Excalibur, and
in the other hand wearing a white gold shield with the symbol of the paladins
etched into the shield. Truly any evil being in the right mind would not want 
to meet him on a bad day with hopes of winning.

passes right through you as you breathe in a sigh of relief that it was only
a illusion. As you notice in this room there are many other illusions of beasts
of unknown names and all being created from nothing. You later find out that 
there is a iron statue sitting in the middle of the room, as you look closer
you find out it is William. The one who creates these beings of destruction and
chaos. All these illusions don't look too scary but then you cring in fear and
terror as these are NOT illusions, but a window to another dimension where 
William resides. You dare not enter the immaterial rift for even the mightiest
of ones stay away from it in order to see the next day.

You can barely see the place, heavily relying on your torch. This place is
pitch black and mysterious. You feel powerful magic in the air, and dare not
speak a word or else the balance of magic may be disrupted and you might end 
up as the receiving end of a lighting bolt. As your eyes get adjusted to the
dim lighting from the torches you have. You gasp in surprise as you see a 
black ebony statue of Wert in the middle of the room, he is garbed in a black
flowing robe and his eyes glow red in the dark burning right at you with a
presence of forboding. What amazes you is that the statue is standing on a
large round iron disk, which floats in the middle of the room. You have a
feeling to push the disk to see if it is a trick, but as you put your hand 
near it, you shrink back in terror as you felt the powerful magic vibrating
through your hand as you get closer to the statue. This is a truly 
mysterious god of unknown origin, which no one has ever seen or lived to tell
about it.

most totally 'kewl' god around Erasmus! The room is very brightly lit with a
opening from the ceiling to the outside, which is sort of like a skylight.
In the painting you see Erasmus himself carrying the mighty claymore readying
for a battle. He is standing atop a mountain as you see in the far off 
distance a huge golden dragon swooping towards him. His face is stone cold and
emotionless, as for his eye....YOU CAN'T see them as they are covered by his

around the tower and above you, with the blue sky and sunlight one has the 
feeling that they can fly with no limits. But you are only mortal and won't
try to have such insane urges. Looking at the mortals below running about,
performing their daily rituals, you have a sudden urge to spit at them from a
great distance. This may be fun and amusing with your friends, but you dare

This being a description of the pocket abyss by Sharkoth, Sage/Explorer.
The pocket abyss is not to be confused with the actual Abyss, that plane of
ultimate chaos and evil. The pocket abyss is a small area that is home to a
number of creatures. And these creatures are not unlike those in the actual
abyss in that they are extremely hostile and chaotic. The area itself may be
divided into 2 main sections, the mercury pool and the Hoeurs tower. The 
mercury pool is where the four elementals (fire, water, earth and air) reside.
The Hoeur makes his home in the tower below the pool. He is guarded by many
sentinels, elven guards, female drow warriors, huge minotaurs and the demon
Marilith. The Hoeur himself is a demon of power. He wields a flaming whip
and is able to cast much magic. The Hoeur is rumoured to be an outcast from
the actual abyss. Whether this is true is not known.

.....but Rhyodin is hard to reach. It is only accessible via the Great Eastern
Desert and the route is long and treacherous. There exists another way. I have
been informed by clerics of highest calibre that it may also be reached by way
of the Astral Plane. Rhyodin is famed as the retreat of Tor, warrior supreme
and high-guildmaster of all warriors.....<The parchment is unreadable here>....
.....A little known fact is that troglodytes reside in some hidden caves here.
They are extremely hostile and will attack intruders on sight. Even thougg they
are not skilled fighters, the sheer weight of their numbers makes them
dangerous foes. The troglodytes are well organised and led by their great Chief.
The chief is aided by his shaman, lieutenants, warriors and guards......
<The rest of the parchment is too faded to read>.

The Astral Plane is a strange plane of existence that may only be reached
by means of the spell 'astral walk'. This spell may only be cast by clerics
of highest calibre and justly so for the astral plane is not a place
for the ill-prepared. Many strange creatures wander the Astral Plane.
Beware the Githyanki and Slaadi. Their hatred of other races is legendary.
Not all of the Astral Planes denizens are hostile, some of the more
peaceful creatures are the berbalang and the invisible stalker. Occassionally
astral-travelling mindflayers may be seen going about their business.
The Astral Plane has one unique aspect that sets it apart. Scattered
throughout the plane are many coloured pools. These pools are in fact
gateways that when entered, lead to other areas in Shadowdale and even
other planes of existence. I have located pools that lead to Old Thalos,
the mystical realm of Graecia and the fair land of Camelot. I have
heard rumours of pools leading to other places, even one leding to the
dreaded abyss.

you realise that the stains on the book are bloodstains. To satisfy your
curiosity you might like to READ DIARY.

YR 103 Day 1: We entered the Jungles of Chult today. Our guide found a route
there north-east of the Shire. We are confident of finding treasures that will
justify our expedition.
Day 2: We have found nothing yet, only insects and snakes.
Day 3: We were attacked by a huge lion today. The skin will make a nice trophy.
Day 5: We have found signs of habitation. Our guide believes that a native
village is nearby. We will soon find out.

Village in Jungle

Hidden Pyramid

village~
Day 6: We have located the village. The villagers were peaceful enough and
strangely seemed unsurprised by our appearance. We were led around the village
by the Village Chief. The princess of the village was very pleased to meet us.
The witch doctor seemd very hostile though. We must watch him closely.
Day 7: The Chief has informed us of a secret lair of some strange lizard-like
men. We will search for it tomorrow.
~
E
lizardmen lizardman tunnels~
Day 10: We have found the entrance to the lizardmens lair. It was carefully
hidden. We will rest and enter it tomorrow.
Day 11: The lair seems to consist of a system of inter-connected passageways
and tunnels. We have had many fights with the lizard creatures which we call
lizardmen. They are vicious and able fighters. Some of our party have fallen
to them.
Day 12: We have located the shrine of these evil creatures. It was guarded
by a Lizardman Shaman of fearsome aspect and size. He succumbed after a fierce
battle but sadly Tyran has fallen, blasted by the Shaman's magics. We have
found some treasure but the cost has been high. We have also found indications
of a hidden pyramid located somewhere in the jungle. We will return to
the village before searching for it.
~
E
hidden pyramid~
Day 20: We have found the pyramid but were unprepared for the reception
we received. The pyramid was guarded by a massive green giant. Several
of our party fell to his onslaught before we overcame him. Oran was hit and
killed by the giants first blow - dark magics must be involved.
Day 22: The pyramid seems to be dedicated to some kind of snake deity. It
is made in the form of a huge snake.
Day 23: We have found an entrance near the top of the pyramid at the snakes
mouth.
Day 24: The pyramid is inhabited by an extremely chaotic cult of snake 
priests. Many of our party have fallen before their ambushes.
Day 26: We entered their shrine today but were beaten back with heavy
losses. They employed huge gaurdian snakes in the attack. We also caught
a brief glimpse of a horrible man-snake creature. Could this be the deity
they worship or is there something even more foul behind this cult?
Day 27: We are lost and cannot get out.
Day 28: Have found an underground river. Maybe we can escape by it.
[The diary seems to have ended abruptly here. There seems to be no
indication of whether the author and his party actually survived.]

Visitors to Shire Town will find it a place bustling with activity. Theres

don't forget to stop by the Shire grocer's. His pipeweed bread is the talk of
Shadowdale. You could also have a chat with old farmer Gamgee or have a look
at the new Shire mill. As you wander about the Shire you may come across
some of the Shires interesting inhabitants such as the Elven Wizard, the
Dwarven Prince or even the elusive Keeper of the Ring. The Shire is protected
by an elite group of halflings known as Shiriffs. Their leader, the Thain,
is definitely not someone you'd like to mess with so make sure you stay in

The Shire is a small village located just west and north of Shadowdale
City. It has the distinction of being the home of the halfling; something
which any halfling would be happy to tell you (usually in much boring
detail). The Shire is also home to the Shire Monastery where monks from
all over Shadowdale come to train. Please refer to the other topics

undershire~
Below the happy, bustling atmosphere of the Shire is a darker side that few
people know about. Undershire is basically a maze of tunnels which have been
overrun by a horde of monsters. Some of the monsters that have been sighted
are ogres and their magic casting brethren, bugbears, beetles, stray dogs
and even a dragon or two( only blue and white dragons have been documented).
Sadly, even the monks have been unable to dislodge these monsters from the
tunnels so firmly entrenched and prolific are they...Maybe some adventurers 
will be able to do it for them? Entry to these tunnels is rumoured to be via
some cellars in the monastery or through an entry tunnel well-guarded by the 
Shiriffs. The sooner someone cleans out this bastion of evil the better things
will be for everyone.

You find yourself inside a huge vault. The vault seems to be impregnated
with magic-deadening substances and anti-magic symbols are etched into
the vault walls. Even these cannot totally suppress the power that
radiates from the tomes stored here. The writings here are incredibly
arcane. Only powerful magics have kept them from returning to dust many

I, Daran the Elder, write this in my seventh decade. This being an account of
my reasearch via scry of the outer plane known as the Abyss. Know ye that the 
Abyss is a place of utmost evil, a fortress of ultimate chaos. It is populated
by fiends and sentinels of awesome power and unmatched hatred for all outsiders
who enter their realm. Learn reader, of the mighty Kraken, lone occupant of
the great Abyssian Sea for he brooks the presence of no other. Learn reader,
of the Abyssian Plains where resides the Treant and where the Githyanki knights
wander. Learn ye reader, of that bastion of chaos and corruption, the Abyssian
Castle. Be warned reader, for the castle is home to many of the Abyss' most
powerful and chaotic beings. Learn O reader of Kalas, knight-protector of the
castle, and of the hydra that guards the great spiral staircase. Learn too of
the demi-lich, arch-mage supreme and truly invulnerable, and of his guardian
the Death Knight, wielder of the great Sword of Ancients. Beware reader of the
Crimson Death whose very touch is bane to life. Hear O reader of the castle's
sentinels, of the white-gold manticores and the fearsome black slayers. And of
the Storm Giants whose ferocity in combat is legendary. Be warned O reader,
only the bravest and hardiest may enter the abyss and only those of utmost
power and ability may return alive.

Dalamar's Shrine~
You stand in the Shrine of Dalamar, a bright golden room that glows with a
light all its own.  Around the walls are various tapestries depicting Dalamar
in all his glory.  In front of you is a tapestry depicting a war between the
good and evil dragons.  The army of good, you notice, is led by Dalamar riding
an enormous gold dragon, and he personally leads a charge into enemy territory.
To the left you see a magical painting of Dalamar standing with all his loyal
followers, protected by the same gold dragon as in the tapestry.  And to your
right is a mural depicting Dalamar, wielding the fabled sword Excalibur and
wearing armor of the purest platinum, downing the most powerful minions of
evil.  In front of you is a small shrine, with a statue of a dragon adorning
it.  You feel moved by what you have seen here, and have the overpowering urge
to pay homage to Dalamar.

woods~
Besides what has been previously mentioned about the forest of Haon-Dor and
its myriad of occupants in special regions, there are a number of other points
of interest within the woods itself.  East of Timnus the guardian is the mighty
mother grizzly bear, a foe powerful enough to strike massive fear into the
hearts of the hardiest veterans.  Too, there is the woodcutter John and the
brownie Shargugh.  Both are not nearly so powerful, but they are able to put
up a decent fight.  Supposedly there is a castle in the forest that holds the
most powerful of beings within it's walls.  For the most part, like the other
creatures residing in the forest itself, the creatures mentioned here are
neutral.  The woods of Haon-Dor are located west of Shadowdale.
~
E
forest~
The Woods of Haon-Dor are a relatively unpopulated zone of this world.  The
only monsters that tend to occupy the zone are the wolves who hunt there and
the great trees, friends of the druids.  More or less, the forest is just a
link between its Eastern neighbor Shadowdale and the more dangerous lands to
the west.  Connections from this zone lead to Shire, the Elven Woods, the
Quicklings, the Great Tree of the Druids, the river, and further west to more
mystical lands.  The creatures of the woods are neutral in alignment.
~
E
elf~
The Elven Woods are a small section of forest populated primarily by the elves
themselves, as well as those animals that live there too.  The area's residents
are primarily good-aligned citizens who love peace more than anything else.
The area is only for those people who are below the tenth level of experience,
as the guardian elf Timnus will prevent all others from entering.  Another
aspect of the woods is the abundance of food, which can be found in the form
of fruit and fish.  The feared weapon known as the Warp Dagger is also said to
be in the hands of the Elven Princess.  Be warned, however, since the elves
mete out punishment for various crimes swiftly and impassionately.  The Elven
Woods are located to the west of Shadowdale.
~
E
quickling~
The quicklings are a species of evil elven type creatures located to the west
of Shadowdale.  While they are no challenge to the veteran fighter, the
newcomer to fighting will probably want to stay away from this zone.  The
special trait that quicklings have is that they are able to attack very
quickly, meaning that they have multiple attacks per round.  They are led
by the cruel king Tephanis, who occasionally has a sword that strikes
quickly on its own, and his bracers that make one more agile and dextrous.

sage and translated into the common tongue by some modern author.  There is a
comfortable chair sitting next to the table, encouraging you to sit down and

desert~
The Great Eastern Desert is a feared place among all wise adventurers.  The
desert itself holds many pitfalls to lure the unwary adventurer in.  There are
multiple exit/maze loops to be found throughout, and probably some death traps
as well.  The most feared monster on all of Toril, the great purple worm, also
resides in the desert.  It requires huge amounts of manpower to kill, and it
is capable of ravaging many a party.  The other monsters in the desert while
also evil, are not nearly as powerful, although they all can hide beneath the
sands.  The Super Repair Guy is sometimes to be found out here.  The high level
warrior guildmaster is supposed to be beyond the dunes to the far east, but the
largest perils lie in that direction as well.  The worm holds many mighty
treasures within its grasp too.  This zone is highly evil, and highly perilous,
but it has its rewards.  The desert is located south of New Thalos.
~
E
new~
New Thalos, Pearl of the East, is ruled peacefully and wisely by the great
Sultan.  The city itself is a slightly larger, Eastern version of Shadowdale.
The constant presence of cityguards keep the peace in the streets and prevent
the lowlife elements from dominating the scene.  The main purpose adventurers
will have for this fabulous city is to train there at higher levels.  The basic
classes:  mage/sorceror, fighter, cleric, and thief, all have upper level
training halls located within the bounds of the city.  The mobs in this city
are primarily good and neutral.  Too, there are many shops that sell all kinds
of interesting items for the adventurer with a heavy purse.
~
E
old~
The fearsome city of Old Thalos is located somewhere within the vast and
perilous Great Eastern Desert.  A crumbling city housing many dangers, the city
has been deemed unsafe for travel as parts may collapse at any time.  The
mosters populating the city are among the most powerful in the game.  Gangs of
lamias wander the streets and attack whatever they see, and the beholder that
rules the city from the Central Temple is unmatched by any monster in the world
in terms of sheer power.  The silver lining to this city, however, is that the
Super Repair Guy can often be found here.  He can repair the most grievous of
damage to weapons short of total ruin for a price.

journal~
This account of my final battles in the service of Shadowdale on their Eastern
frontier is dedicated to my loyal soldiers who died alongside me.
General Patton Tarrasch

Section 1:  Moria and the Unhuman war
Section 2:  Castle Python and the Grand Siege
Section 3:  Arachnos and the Insectoid War
~
E
moria~
- We camped on the outskirts of the cave complex of Moria.  Rumor has it that
  the goblins and others of their kind are going to invade the city, so my
  army and I were sent to stop them.  We were left unbothered during the night.
- We cleared the top level of Moria, an amazingly simple feat.  The orc and
  goblin tribes, supplemented by kobolds were hardly a match for us fighters,
  although some of the squires were grievously hurt in today's battle.  We
  heard rumors of a powerful force down below.
- We sallied forth into the underground this morning.  Finding the groups of
  yesterday reinforced by human mercenaries and ogres, not to mention a legion
  of elite hobgoblins, we were shoved back into a golden cave.  There, guardian
  serpents and a powerful evil mage drove us back on all fronts.  We took refuge
  at last night's battlelines.
- We snuck down around to the lowest floor of Moria this morning.  A brutal
  counterattack shattered the last of the resistance that the forces down there
  had, as the thieves were unwilling to fight too much.  We found an elite
  guildmaster we respectfully left alone.  We rose up out of the dungeons and
  considered our task a success.
~
E
python~
- Our massed armies descended towards the castle of Python, located only a few
  miles east and south of the town.  The Mayor decided that the castle is too
  powerful to be let alone, so we were assigned the duty of taking care of them
  and their power.  As we camp for the night, the imposing structure looks like
  it should house many hundreds of guards.
- One of the biggest shocks of my career had to be when we stormed the castle
  today.  Not only did they open the gates for us, but there must not have been
  more than ten guards in the whole place!  We routed most of them quickly,
  only having problems with the muscle-bound geeks in the weight room.  On the
  morrow we shall go see the lord of this place.
- Lord Python has finally fallen, but at what cost!  The man is a fighting
  machine, far beyond the abilities of our men!  Only by sheer numbers did we
  bring him down, and thus end the threat to our fair town.
~
E
arachnos~
- Our greatest challenge as of yet arrives upon us.  We have been asked to root
  out all foul denizens of the forests of Arachnos.  This will challenge even
  our best fighters, as the creatures fight in mysterious ways, and can kill
  with a single bite.
- We attacked the slave pens within Arachnos today, routing the hapless beings
  with ease.  Following that, we descended into a canyon and shredded a group
  of spiders with the help of our mage Botarvv.  Unfortunately one of the
  damnable creatures killed him at the end.  Ah, that's life on the warfront.
- We checked back on our path and found a mighty queen bee this afternoon.
  It took most of our forces to defeat it, but our job is not yet finished,
  and I am resolved to see the task to completion.  My last few fighters and I
  will fight on to the bitter end.
- I write this with the last strength I have... bitter is defeat, and the
  quashing of life that comes with it.  We found numerous secret passages and
  stumbled into a massive dragon lair.  There, the mighty Yevaud, armed and
  armored with mystical and rare items, put an end to my days.  I only hope
  that my journal can help someone in the future...

Good luck to Shadowdale... General Tarrasch

end world~
Trapped beyond all hope of returning!  How could this have happened to me?
I wandered northeast of Camelot looking for a village to plunder.  Instead, I
find a massive beast thing in a nearby cave, thieves like myself in the woods,
the shoreline slowly floating out to sea, and when I see if there is an island
out there, I get blinded by the sun and float onto an island I can't get off
of!  Please, someone, help me and rescue me in one way or another!  I will
reward you handsomely (by sticking a dagger into your back) for doing so!
HELP!
~
E
forest woods rhowyn~
These forests are deserted entirely.  Nothing, NOTHING at all to kill here or
to loot from!  This is a waste of time working around here!  They oughta cut
down these twisty confusing woods.  The only sign of life I even saw around
here was the troll... good thing I can swim, that guy is a toughie.  Sticking
my dagger in his back was nice though, lots of muscle and meat to cut through.
Too bad he had no gold... woulda been nice to loot him.  At least now I can
get from the Camelot area to the Mage's Tower, though why I would want to visit
either again is beyond me...
~
E
carnival fairgrounds maypole~
The fairgrounds of the Maypole are located to the west of Camelot and those
thrice-damned paladins.  Anyway, this place offers slim pickings.  While the
few living creatures you can call people are easy enough to destroy, there is
just no money around for the taking.  Why I bothered coming here is beyond me.
You have all kinds of circus attractions that gather people who don't have
the money to pay for them, and then you have the FREAKS.  These malformed things
are no better than the rest of the crowds.  There has to be money around here
somewhere... I just know it.
~
E
mage tower~
This place is one of the most horrible places to ever try to overthrow!  All
ye would-be thieves and world emperors, STAY away from here.  The minions about
are really powerful, and they don't appreciate thieves.  They can hit hard, do
a ton of damage, and they throw magic around like it would go out of vogue on
the morrow.  That Grenetta, who is a guildmaster of some sort, is absolutly
deadly to cross.  I would rather jump in a death trap than try to backstab her
and her minions again!  Anyway, that's that for a try here... will have to
really clean up elsewhere tomorrow...

Wylie Baker's diary on Camelot:
This area is full of putrid goodness.  They fill their coffers at the peasant's
expense, calling it righteous taxtation.  Then, they sit on their fat rear ends
in their "mighty" castle and make laws to further persecute the peasants.  You
can't kill them because they can resist backstabs, and that cleric guildmaster
who sits at Arthur's side is invincible!  What a place... maybe I could make a
killing by kidnapping that queen... something has to be done to knock those
powerful do-gooders of their righteous pedestals... hmmmm.....

diary~
This seems to be Wylie Baker's personal diary as he travelled throughout the
lands north of New Thalos, plotting the world's downfall and seeking to rob
the world blind.

As you glance through the diary, it seems to be broken up into several main
sections...
Camelot and Prydain
The Mage's Tower
The Maypole and Carnival
The Forests of Rhowyn
The End of the World

Shelves of Lore~
You walk between shelves covered in books.  A number of them appeal to you, as
they have information relating to the various areas around Shadowdale.  To see
a list a topics, check the book lying along the dusty floor.

Graecia~
Graecia is a small chain of islands and some landed regions lying on another
plane whose entrance can be found to the far west and north of Shadowdale.  The
whole area is pattered after the legends and myths of Ancient Greece, i.e. the
Minotaur, Medusa, the harpies, the cyclopses, etc.  There are also serpents,
pirates, mermaids, a golem, Queen Hippolyta and the amazons, the Nemean Lion,
and a hydra.  Most of the monsters in the region tend to be evil, meaning that
your alignment will shift towards good as you kill here.  Most of the monsters
can be slain by a small group levels 15-25, or a hardy upper-level individual.
There are also some nice armor items, primarily cloaks, guarded by some of the
monsters here.  Graecia also has connections to Hades and Olympus.  WARNING:
the whole region is extraplanar, thus normal methods of recall will not work.
~
E
hades~
Hades is a diabolically evil zone located just to the east and slightly below
Graecia.  The denizens here are among the most powerful in all of the game.
The exceptional level 50 individual will be able to clear the whole zone, but
most high level people will have to come in groups to experience success
without dying.  There once in a while is a rare treasure to be found within
the zone.  This zone is populated by torturers, ropers, and acid monsters, and
has the unique monsters Vlad the Impaler, the Master Torturer, and the Master
Centaur
~
E
olympus~
Mt. Olympus is an area for those who seek a real challenge in their fights.
Populated by the Greek gods, who have fantastic powers of their own, this zone
will give a true test of skill to the elite.  These gods are primarily good and
neutral, and have mystic powers beyond the understanding of mere mortals.  This
zone too, is extraplanar, and is located to the east and above Graecia.

More Shelves of Lore~
You walk into a dusty area of the library shelves.  Obviously no one has used
this area in a while.  Lying under piles of dust are a number of aging tomes.
However, you see one rather new tome lying on the shelves.  On it's front cover
is a picture, sorta like an aerial view, of the city of Shadowdale.

book~
This leatherbound tome holds key information for the adventurer concerning the
city of Shadowdale and immediate surrounding areas.  While you are uninterested
in military history, tourism figures, etc., you find several chapters about the
perils and pitfalls around the area.
Areas...
Torture Keep <read torture>
Spiderhaunt Woods <read spiderhaunt>
The Chess Board <read chess>
The Temple of Lathander <read temple>
The City of Shadowdale <read city>
Economics of Shadowdale <read shops>
~
E
torture~
The Torture keep is supposedly a facility that used to be a prison for the most
dangerous inmates of Shadowdale years ago.  Eventually, the prison was
forgotten by the people of Shadowdale.  Mutating, these inmates took control of
the facility.  Controlling the whole area and committing positively evil acts,
the inmates hold tremendous power.  The facility is located south of Shadowdale
and is intended for mid and high level groups.  There are several special items
held by the dastardly monsters, including some powerful weaponry of some sort.
~
E
spiderhaunt~
The Spiderhaunt Woods are primarily a newbie area to adventure and gain your
first experience in fighting your enemies.  The main population around here
are a small group of goblins who have a camp in the area.  Also within the
area are typical forest creatures like wolves and spiders.  The monsters here
are primarily neutral and slightly evil.  This area is intended for newbies,
with no special dangers or items involved.
~
E
chess~
The Chess Board is another newbie zone designed for the beginning player who
is either staring out or practicing some skills on the mobs.  Located within
the Ivory Tower on the west side of Shadowdale, the Chess Board is intended for
those people under level 10.  The mobs include chess pieces which increase in
power as would a real chess piece.  The special monsters in the zone are the
Jabberwocky and the Flame.  The Flame supposedly has a powerful sword and
mystical leggings.  The monsters here are either a little good or a little evil
depending on their color.  Besides what has been mentioned, there are also
other mobs such as Net Lag, the Oil Beasts, and Jugglernauts.  They are of
medium power to a low-level player.
~
E
temple~
The Temple of Lathander is located in the northern section of Shadowdale.
Containing many useful rooms, as well as a labrynth of rooms in its western
section, the Temple is an integral part of any adventurer's life.  The donation
room is where a new adventurer can often find his first weapons and armor.  The
mortal-mortal/mortal-immortal bulletin board is also located in this structure,
and the Hall of Rules is located within too.  The labrynth has a myriad of mid
level creatures that are intended for groups of PCs around level 5, or for the
solo effort on level 10+
~
E
city~
The city of Shadowdale is the base for most of the adventurers on this world.
A fortress of goodness, the city is actively patrolled by the cityguards in
force.  The cityguards themselves, and the more powerful Guard Royales are
powerful fighting forces of goodness.  Within the city are many shops (see next
chapter please) and the guilds for all the character classes except the druid
and monk.  In the southern part of the city reside the mayor and the Grand
Knight of Paladins.  The Knight has much armor of the purest good, excellent
wear for paladins and rangers.  The other key resident of the city is Elminster
the mage, one of the most fearsome figures in all the game.  Shadowdale is
located on top of Shadowdale  :)
~
E
shops~
Besides the aforementioned aspects of Shadowdale, the town serves as the
commercial center of the region.  Along the main street are shops selling all
sorts of weapons and armor, magic items and potions, food, and adventuring
needs.  If you look further in the town, there is an inn, a tavern to sell you
alcoholic needs, and a scribe to mail your best friends with the latest gossip.
Just bring your money, since the shops DON'T take Visa OR American Express.

Like any living being, you must have food and water to sustain a healthy life.
You will find shops all around town that will gladly sell you the necessary
nourishments..provided that you also have the necessary monitary units.  You
will also find two complimentary cups and breads in your inventory to start you
off with.  If you should happen to run out of food-and money, you many be able
to locate some in the 'Donation Room'.  There is also a despensing water f    
fountain located at the 'Meeting Square' for your refreshment needs.  You may
choose to sip your drinks or taste your food for means of conserving.  This
way the food/drinks do not go away as quickly..but of course you aren't as full
as you would be if you had consumed it whole.

pamphlet~
Here is where you learn all about leveling.  When you go off and fight a mob,
you will get experience for it.  Your experience will accumulate throughout
every fight.  When you reach the necessary experience for the next level, you
will need to go to your guildmaster and "gain".  There, you will gain more hp
more mana, and sometimes more v (movement/vitality).  You will also get a few
practice sessions.  This process goes on throughout your adventurous life.  The
higher level you are, natually the more you can kill.  The amount of xp needed
for you next level should appear in your "score" , you may also type "level
<class>" to see the amount of total experience required for each level.  It 
gives you a list of the level xp amount and title for each level.

practice~
You probably did a "pr <class>" earlier and were disappointed to see that most,
if not all, of your skills/spells were either (not learned) or (bad).  No need
to worry, because you can change that!  All you need to do is go to your
guildmaster and he/she will kindly help you better your skills/spells.  When
you go to him/her, be sure to type "practice" or "pr" with no arguments to
see how many practice sessions you have, and the skills/spells available to you.
You may then choose to spend those practice sessions by typing "pr <skill/spell
name>" , or save it for later and higher skills/spells.
~
E
sing~

~
E
sign~
For those of you who are multi-class:
The amount of practice sessions that you see at one guild is the TOTAL amount
of the practice sessions that you have for all your classes.  For example, if
you are mage/warrior and you go to the mage guild and notices that you have 4
practices sessions.  If you spend 3 of those sessions for your mage spells, 
then you will only have 1 session left for when you go to your warrior guild.
You obtain more practice sessions everytime you gain a level.

To get a more exact estimate of the opponent, consult the Loremaster located in
Mordinlia.  He might has some useful skills that he can teach you so that you
can obtain more information about the mob you are killing.  We also have an 
area specifically designed for those curious of mobs.  You may want to take a
browse at that.  It contains some useful background history on the mobs of
Shadowdale.
~
E
battle~
Okay, okay, okay..so you wanna know about killing mobs, eh?  Well, a smart
adventurer will never attack anything that he/she is unsure of.  To know if
you can kill a mob, you simply "Consider" them.  A much used abbreviation for
that would be "con".  You should keep in mind, however, that just because a mob
has been "con" at Easy, or Rather Easy, dosen't necessarily mean that you can
beat them.  Con is a rough esitmate by your level and the opponent's.  See
'more' for more information.

actually quite simple.  Since you should have already learned about the command
"help", you can easily find out what PRAY does.  Just type "h pray" to see.
You may only pray ONCE per day, and the possibility of your prayer going thru
is based on your level/experience, as well as your class.  When you pray, be
sure to INCLUDE the name of your deity, otherwise it is most likely left
unanswered.  Format of the prayers should be as follows:
Pray <diety name>  <Prayer>
Examples are:
pray Celestian will you kindly direct me to the route of Moria?
pray Ator may I have a sanctuary potion please?

Be sure to keep your prayers short and to the point.
(NOTE:  Praying to a god that is not logged on at the current time will most
likely leave your prayers unanswered as well.)

Sometimes you will have two of the same thing in your inventory..such as cups

one of it you want to deal with.  It is very important to put that little dot
there.  If there is a pile of the same thing on the ground and you want to get
a pile of one particular item, type 'get all.<name>".
An example would be "get all.cup" .  You will pick up all the cups you can carry
and leave anything else on the ground.  The same will work for mobs.  If you
wish to look at a specific mob when there are more than two of the same.  Just
type "look 2.<mob name>".  You will notice that this command is very useful

Gold elves aren't as friendly as Moon elves and at first glance seem to

before they find themselves fleeing arrows and mad elven warriors.
They do not trust outsides easily but once befriend by make

mountains, woods, plains and water.

from here. The wind pulls you from left to right and back. This seems like a

Otherwise you would risk death by falling to the hard ground below. DO NOT

As you descend, the chain seems to absorbe all weather around it, making it
swing less and less in the very powerful wind tearing at it. The Chain seems
to chuckle quietly, and as you descend further you hear a soft whisper
originating from within the Chain *ITSELF*. 
It says, " Welcome back some other time, stranger. Your company is always
           ... hmmm ... interesting. God Speed. "
The chain extends further down through the now spreading clouds.

Weird Abandoned Temple~
This room is made out of a faintly glowing green stone. Several disturbing 
shapes are carved into the stone. These shapes seem to dance and move in

is to the south and a black temple lies to the west.

Looking about this cavern, you are struck by its natural beauty. The roof is 
a full 200 feet over your head. A small pond lies to the east. The entire area

glittering before you. A large opening lies to the north. To the south, you 
see a tunnel leading off into the darkness. A small crack to the west affords
you a possible entrance into a cave.

You are in a hallway which has not been cleared out fully. Piles of rock are
pushed up against both sides of the hallway clearing a rough path to the north.
What little of the floor you see is remarkably smooth and finished. Strange 
that there would be debris scattered on it. A small opening to the west gives
you access to what looks like a natural cavern. The hallway continues on to the
east and the path through the debris leads off to the north.

An icy cave~
   You are standing in a small cave, which lies open to the outside to
the west.  A large crevice leads eastwards, and there might be a light
of some kind in that general direction.   This room looks to be about
man sized, much smaller than the other rooms in this complex.  It is
doubtful a giant would just wander in here, without a reason.

noises to the east, but it may just be a trick of the wind

sized chunks, or use the mortar and pestle to grind the victim up into a
thick soup-like mixture, which they dunk pieces of ice into, like a dip.

Darkening Spider Haunt Woods~
  As you enter the Spider Haunt the silence becomes more oppressive
making you wonder if anything lives here in the wood. The tall trees
begin to block out the light and you are forced to come up with some
sort of light source to see. The small path you follow looks well
travelled but you do not see any new tracks.

Several Passages~
Large stone arches cover each exit leading from this room. To the west
a nasty looking wolf's head peers down from his arch. Eastwards a small
rabbit seems to nibble at a carving of grass, blind to the
wolf peering from the west. A large hawk has been carved into the arch of
the north exit, it's wings spreading all the way down to the floor forming
the outer edges of the doorway. The archway to the south is plain, utterly
void of any carving what-so-ever.

a dim purple light off in that direction. To the west the natural caves
disappear into a weaving mass of stone. You begin to hear noises off

Nearing a Purple Light~
A deep purple light emits from somewhere to the north, several sounds
echo off the natural cavern walls. Some even sound like voices. You
get the urge to be a bit more quiet not sure what what lies ahead. The 
cavern to the south is silent.

Large Glowing Gates~
Large gates demands your attention here, they glow with a deep purple,
almost black light. The gates are made of a black metal that seems to 
absorb any light shed here. In the center of the gates a large spider 
creature has been worked in metal, if the gates were to open the large
spiders maw would open wide to accept you. Were the eyes of the spider
would be several gems have been inlayed into the metal. Plainly the gates
are magical, and surely there are guards to protect what ever lies behind
those evil looking eyes.

Large Stone Door~
The passage ends at a large stone door. This cavern has been cleaned
of all stone shards and dirt, near the wall to the west two chairs
lean against the wall. There is no handles on the door on the east wall,
it is probably opened from the other side only, to best protect someone
or something. In a small alcove about waist high a lantern has been placed
to light up the cavern.

to protect a passage, but then you see signs of the residents living here.
From the tools and barrels and markings on these items you would guess
that dwarves live near here. A few wheel barrels and picks lie near the

metal weapons, tools and other things are made. A large anvil rests near

moss and fungus that grows on the walls.  You hear the sounds of combat off in
the distance as you walk, and the floor here feels a little sandy beneath your
feet.

Outer Gate of House Baenre~
Before you sits House Baenre, first house of Menzoberranzan.  This
massive complex is formed of roughly oval ring of stalagmites connected
at their bases by what appears to be a silvery spider's web.  Twenty
feet high, with strands thick as a drow's arm, the web is a formidable
barrier to those who would test the strength of this great house.
Before you, to the north, between the largest pair of stalagmites, is a
magnificent gate.  To either side, sits a statue of a giant black spider.

spectacular one.  Positioned directly above you is a fortified
stalactite, guards man both the fortifications, and levitate in the
air beside it.  To the south of course, is the gate leading in.

You have entered the staggeringly immense temple of House Baenre.
Your eyes instantly lock on the awesome illusion floating possesively
in the air above the altar.  It depicts the dark goddess Lloth shifting
slowly from a black spider, whose limbs twitch in an almost hypnotic
pattern that makes you desire to walk into her dark embrace, to the
most beautiful and terrible female drow you have ever seen.  The
room itself is so big you get the feeling that it could house every
living being in the whole city if it needed to.  Rows of seats circle
the chamber and desend level by level to a great open floor in
the very center of the building.  In the middle of the floor raises a
great altar to Lloth.  A low chanting fills the room, then stops as
a figure on the altar raises a strange spider shaded dagger over the
heart of a figure bound to the altar.

light in her eyes.  "DEFILERS!" she screams, and all about you, drow
take up the and desend down upon you.  Still others race from the
temple to sound the alarm.  You have more present worries however, for

fire designs are more incredible then anything you have seen up to

each door.  Above you, the stairway widens and turns into a 
grand platform leading to a massive adamantine door.  The symbol of
Lloth sits above the symbol of House Baenre, and to either side of
these sit a matched pair of the symbols of Matron Malice Baenre herself.

for a drow body.  Laid out on it is a robe, also seemingly ill 
designed for a drow form.  Finally, you see a strange shape move
out of the shadows.  Roughly humanoid up to the shoulders, the
similarity ends there.  Looking like nothing more then a squid's head
on top of a humanoid form, the mind flayer stares at you with pale white
eyes, lacking any pupil.  Then the next thing you know, your brain
is on fire as El-Viddenvelp releases his awesome mental energies
upon you.

torturered souls.  At the end of each of the chair's arms, a diamond
of incredible size is embedded.  Resting in this throne is a drow so
ancient and withered that she seems almost corpselike, but the 
power of her gaze leaves no doubt that she is an awesome foe to be dealt
with.  About her stand her personal attendants and guards, though you find
it doubtful that she needs protection from anyone.

intricate carvings of spiders eating humanoid creatures in it, if that
doesn't say welcome I don't know what does!  In the center of the gate is a
gargoyle's head.  The mouth of the gargoyle is open as if he was screaming.
You consider climbing over the wall but that is when you notice the sharp
spikes on top of it, climbing over them would be impossible.  A pathway lies
to the south through the gate towards the stalagmite.

chambers to the east, and west.  Before you are able to take in fully the
possibility of living in such a place, a guard notices you.  The guard rushes

sounds and a regiment of guards appear from a puff of smoke.

A sense of foreboding overcomes you as you enter this room.  You have the
feeling that you really shouldn't be in here.  Various statues of spiders are
along the walls, and you can see a very large one to the north.  Small black
candles are burning in crevices along the walls.  This is the place where the
occupants of the house come to worship Lloth, there are no chairs here, all
must kneel before the great spider god.

Altar of Lloth~
You decide, against your better judgment, to go towards the altar.  A
humungous statue of a spider is above the altar.  Red rubies are where the
eyes on the spider should be, the statue seems to be peering at you as if it
was alive.  A marble slab is in front of you under the statue.  There ate 4
chains on the slab, one at each corner, located in such as manner as if to
hold some creature down for sacrifice.  Some dry, encrusted blood is still on
the altar, you better get out of here before you become the next victim.

Matron's Throne Room~
A red carpet flows from the entrance to the room in the north, to an elegant
throne on the south wall of the room.  The throne is made of the skeletal
remains of various humanoid type races.  Each arm rest if made of a skeletal
arm, with the hand grasping a large sapphire, which sparkles in the light.
This is the throne room of the matron mother, great painting of the lineage
of this mother and the battles she has fought line the walls.  Very few
humans have been to the room and lived to tell about it.  From the look on
the matrons face as you enter her throne room, she doesn't plan on you being
the first person to leave alive.

Matron's Bedroom~
This is the bedroom of the matron mother. Black is by far the most abundant
color in this room.  Black tapestries hang from the wall, black sheets and
blankets are on the bed, which looks very comfortable.  A huge mirror is on
the south wall, it seems to be warped a bit to make a person look skinnier
than they actually are.  There is a closet full of the matrons clothes, very
tacky and nothing you would want, on the west wall.  There are two guards in 
this room that constantly serve to protect the matron while she is in this
room.  They probably aren't too pleased to see you.

Nothing is going to stand between you and your gold!

Nearing the House Do'Urden~
The dark caverns and the arena fall away behind you to the west, and the sounds
of swordplay grow ever more faint.  Rising above you is the imposing structure
of House Do'Urden, radiating power in all its majesty.  The guards you notice
are much more numerous up ahead, and the security is tighter too, all as you
approach a mighty seat of power.

and into the cave the ancient family Daermon N'a'shezbaernon.  Glares from the
guards follow your every move, as if they were planning to stick their swords
in your backs at their earliest convienence.  Down leads to the family's arena
and to the east lies the main part of the house.

You walk through the rocky floor of the cave that House Do'Urden rests in.
The house looms to the east of you, and the commoners and slaves walk around
handling the various tasks of upkeep and devotion on the house.  To the north
and south lie low mounds housing the slaves of the household.  The gate to the
city lies west, and to the east is the House structure itself.

Lower Floor of House Do'Urden~
You enter the lavish surroundings of House Do'Urden.  Do not let the luxury be
a trap, however, since the most deadly of the underground races, the drow, are
still residents of this area.  To your west is the courtyard of this mighty
house and further is the gate and the arena.  To the east is the Grand Temple
where all the drow go to pray on festival days and days of battle.  To the
north and south are soldiers' barracks.  Did I say barracks?  The soldiers come
pouring out of the doorways with all their weaponry, intent on your death!!!

Matron Malice's Private Chambers~
This room practically hums with power and dedication to the Spider Queen as you
walk through the double doors.  This room must belong to Matron Malice Do'Urden
who herself is in the highest graces of the Spider Queen.  You see a large
double bed in the shape of a gigantic spider in one corner of the room, large
enough to sleep at least two people.  Sitting on the bed and pondering his
miserable fate in life is the family's patron, Rizzen Do'Urden.  He turns to
see who has entered and a wicked grin crosses his face!  He vaults over the
bed, draws his sword, and viciously attacks you!  At the same time, Malice
Do'Urden enters from behind with a massive snake-headed whip and attacks you
from behind!  You are in trouble now!

You enter the mighty temple of House Do'Urden, under the watchful stares of
numerous statues.  The statues all represent Lloth in some way, either as
spiders or as beautiful and naked drow females.  These statues are spotlessly
clean as well.  Rows of pews fill the room, all facing the front of the room
where the altar stands.  This room looks like it could hold all the drow of
this house and then some.  Looking up into the cavernous ceiling, you see an
opening from the noble's level, obviously from where Matron Malice makes her
grand appearance to lead prayers and hymns of praise to Lloth.  There is an
exit to the main complex to the west and a small doorway off to the east, from
which you hear constant prayers.

You have arrived in the upper hallways of House Do'Urden, a place where only
the building's nobles tread, and then even lightly in fear of the awesome power
that the house's mother commands.  You quickly come to a decision and move on
your way.

Balcony~
You stand on the balcony of House Do'Urden, shivering in the chill breeze that
extends up this far in the cave.  Immediately in front of you are the grounds
of the house, bustling with activity as the commoners go about their daily
business.  In the distance, you can see the whole of the city of Menzoberranzan
and the various schools of the Academy.  Lit by Narbondel, the time pillar that
illuminates the city and serves as a clock, you can make out the structures of
Arach-Tinilith, Melee-Magthere, and Sorcere.  You also see the great mushroom
grove and the powerful houses within, including mighty Baenre and the seat of
the ultimate power in the city.  The myriad of lights throughout the city seem
to twinkle on and off at random.

small table within the walls of this spacious abode.  However, most of this
chamber is filled with idols and paintings and illuminations of the Spider
Queen that Briza worships along with the rest of her people.  On the wall
opposite you hangs a deadly spiked adamantite mace that is definitely NOT for
show.  Briza comes tearing around from behind her bed and prayers, grabs a
massive six-headed snake whip, and swings it at you with all her considerable
strength!  She is a deadly foe indeed, and those snakeheads are pretty good
competition for you!

priestess.  A soft chanting comes from a hunched figure in the back of the room
and it suddenly turns around and snarls at you!  Vierna Do'Urden, priestess of
Lloth grabs her whip and attacks you in the name of Lloth!

some of the strange drow magic that is present everywhere you go.

effects that the person who sleeps here is never without them.  There is a
large portrait of Lloth on the wall behind the bed, and you see a figure in
supple silvery armor kneeling before it saying his daily prayers.  Noticing
your entrance, the figure stands up and whirls upon you!  Sword and dirk
slashing, the fearsome fighter Dinin Do'Urden screams a praise to his Spider
Queen as he slashes out with his weapons!

room, and Maya kneels in front of it reverently, the High Priestess of Lloth
offering up her prayers to her wicked deity until she realizes that you are

you with her mace while screaming praises to Lloth!

room appears to be a floor for training with weapons.  This room looks to be
much used, and there is even another bedroll in the corner, probably that of
Drizzt Do'Urden, Secondboy of House Do'Urden.  Neither one is present though,

wall of this chamber, apparantly used by Matron Malice when she presides over
her family, dictating Lloth's and her will to them.  Other than the throne, you
notice nothing else in particular about the room besides the various references
to Lloth the Spider Queen.  In one corner is a hole in the floor, leading down
to the commoner's level.

chapel of some sorts.  As you observe your surroundings, a number of the
commoner priestesses curse at you and grab their maces and shields to attack
you!  Defend yourself!

Nebulous Chasm~
You step into a rather well lit room.  The room is not supported by common 
rescources such as a torch or small fire..but the walls itself seem to emit
a soft but strong glow.  A few bones lay together in a pile of rat pellets
off in a corner.

     This grand hall is richly furnished with many tapestries. Tons of
gold, silver, and platinum were used to craft the many fine fixtures. The
size of hall need to hold all these riches is vast. So vast that you must
have travelled a mile to get to your present location, although you have
taken a few steps inside.
     Exits lead in all directions.

green carpet and the walls are made of flawless black marble. There are many
plants all over the room covering most of the walls and reaching to the
ceiling. It almost appears that you are in a lush forest, deep in space. You
swear you can see a star twinkle on the wall. On the north wall there is a 
gigantic painting of a sea serpent swimming at sunset. A large, comfortable
bed sits below the painting, promising a soothing rest. Beside the bed two
braziers burn furthering the awe inspiring effect. A beautiful waterfall 
cascades down the rocky, marble of the southern wall, beginning in 
nothingness and ending in absolution. The sound soothes you to your very 
being. A large view screen hangs from the ceiling above the foot of the
bed.

Shadows dance and play about this part of the forest. Some of these
shadows seem so real, but who would be crazy enough to come this far
into a dark forest, to be casting a shadow. Other than yourself that
is. A less promising path leads off north through the forest. You

there was once a path to the north, but the trees have overcome it.

Wylie's Lair~
   The room you are in is large and filled with many stolen items
that have been scattered all over the place. The floor is covered
with silk pillows and other forms of bedding, probably stolen 
from some unfortunate merchant. A large finely crafted oak table
and chairs have been placed in the center of the room, it looks like a
comfortable place to sit and ponder a body's next move. The northern
wall is covered with a large map of some city. The room is lit by
hanging oil lamps that have been strategically placed about the room,
casting more shadows than normal. You wonder what reasoning there 
could be behind this. A huge tapestry has been hung on the western
 wall, covering it completely. The heavy scent of jasmine fills the air, 
bringing your attention back to the eastern door through which you came.
You think to yourself...you could plot to rob the world from this place!

Forest path~
   The forest here begins to look less and less friendly. The nice trail 
leading north to nicer places looks really inviting. The trees start
to close in around you, blocking out most of the sun's welcome rays.
Shadows dance and play about this part of the forest. Some of these
shadows seem so real, but who would be silly enough to come this far
into a dark forest, other than yourself of course. A less inviting
path leads off north through the forest. You would have to be very 
brave or foolhardy (maybe a bit of both) to continue on north.

north towards the unknown. The forest is so thick that only faint

to the west you notice the shadows moving and dancing about, almost as if
they aren't shadows at all! The tall, menacing trees close in around you
cutting you off from the rest of the forest. A horrible smell wafts from
the south, almost causing you to retch.  Alas, you are cut off from 
investigating the source, much to your disappointment.

ancient trees reach skywards, touching the very edge of the
sky. The forest looks as if some of the trees and brush
have been disturbed by someone or something. Off to the
east, the forest looks unchanged. The smell of death is
very strong here, causing you to almost retch again.
Whatever the source of the smell is, it must be quite near!
If there was only a way to get through the tightly spaced
trees to the south, so you could investigate further. Alas 
the path north is the only accessible exit. The smell will
have to remain a mystery for now.

trees have overcome it. The only means of escape is the light path leading
south towards safer places. A sense of relief fills you knowing that you

as if something had ripped them apart in a fit of blind rage. The 
huge trees that do remain are so enormous that they do not allow
any natural light here. The cave to the west is even more of a 
sight. The outside of the cave is a mixture of reddish brown and
black. This doesn't seem to be a very nice place to visit. The 
final hint of the emanate peril awaiting you in the cave, is the
human bones fused to the side of the cave with what seems to have 
once been armor melted over the bones. It is almost as if this 
was some sort of sick trophy. The smell of rotting flesh is 
overpowering to the west, while friendlier places await you to 
north, or at least you hope.

palace. A large steel grating leads down into darkness, and an iron door
returns you to the hallway.

Garden~
You have entered the Sultan's private gardens. A light sweat breaks out
on your skin from the humidity here. All around you are thousands of
exotic plants and flowers. The sweet smell of jasmine and honeysuckle
reminds you of happier days at home. Off to the north, through the palm
trees, you see a delicate white gazebo. To your right stands a gold sign.
A path leads out into the hallway and west towards the gazebo.

A Split in the River~
The waters of the river crash down upon a rock and splits into
two bodies of water. The river you are on continues its southern
course and the new river heads off to the east. To  your west you notice
that the rocks have split and crumbled as if torn asunder by some massive
force.  It looks impossible to traverse. The River of lost souls also
continues to the north.

the go to great lengths to keep all the roads in order. Although
the taxes in New Thalos are higher then other cities in the realm
most of the money is used for the good of the people.

The Dragon Sea~
 You are on the clear blue seas of the Dragon Sea. 
 Water extends in all directions as far as the eye
 can see. Off in the distance you think you might 
 see a small dock to the west.

Gambreezzi's Frozen Food Section~
This room appears to be carved from solid ice.  In fact it reminds you
of a hollow ice cube, except you are standing in the middle of it!
Brrr...sure is cold in here.  Neatly stacked throught this chamber of
ice are row after row of frozen treats.  You can see packages, ranging
from corn and peas to spinach and okra.  Strangely enough, all of the
packages have a funny little label of a BIG GREEN Giant and they read
"Jolly Green Giant".  As you examine the massive stacks of frozen goodies,
you lose control of your appetite, and begin gobbling these tasty 
treats.  Suddenly you hear a deep voice say 'HO HO HO'.  At first you
are startled, but then you relax.  You realize this is the home of the
Jolly Green Giant.  But BEWARE, those muscles and that BIG GREEN club
mean business, so it would be wise no to anger him.

Entrance to Graecia~
You have arrived in a strange place indeed.  You are standing on the
crest of of a huge hill.  The meadow at your feet is peaceful and calm,
unlike the savage world that you are accustomed.  The meadow extends
northward to a paved road which extends beyond the range of your vision.
The view from this hill is awesome.  You have an excellent aerial view
of this strange place.  To the northeast is gigantic mountain, extending
above the clouds, that towers above the lands below.  To the northwest is
vast ocean stretching out of sight.  You can also make out a city at
the end of the great paved road to the north.  There is also an old
wooden sign which seems to mystically entice you to read it.

The Great Brick Road~
It is strange indeed to travel on such a straight and smoothly paved
road.  You notice several deeply worn grooves that seem to run parallel
to the direction of the road.  These ruts almost seem to be part of the
road design, but you know better.  To the north the road extends northward to
the great city on the horizon.  To your east you see the beginning of a
great forest that makes Mirkwood seem feeble in comparison.

On the Road to Graecia~
The road continues to the north and the city is slowly getting closer.
The forest to the east seems even more ominous.  You get the feeling
that someone is monitoring your progress.  To the west is a large
building.  As you peer at the building the architecture seems quite foreign
to you.  There are large columns with bas reliefs of great battles supporting
the roof.  You hear the sound of laughter and cheering from inside the
building.  There is also a large insignia of the arched entrance of a
huge sword.  You are overwhelmed by the feeling of safety which issues
forth from the building.

Inside the building you notice a large hole in the ceiling which
illuminates the entire room.  There is a small reflecting pool beneath
the hole which serves as a basin for the rainwater.  Inside the building
are several armored men and women talking to each other, they all stare
at you as you enter, then quickly return to the business.  Along the
walls of this building are larger pictures of fabled monsters and
fearless men fighting to the death.  You also can make out a smaller
exit to the north that seems hidden.  To the north you can hear the
the sounds of water splashing against great rocks.

The Eastern Edge of the Great Ocean~
You have arrived at the eastern edge of the Great Ocean.  There are huge
boulders scattered along the rocky coast.  As the ocean collides with
boulders you feel uneasy.  It reminds you that the strange lands in which
you have entered are filled with great mystery.  Looking out to sea you
can make out several rocky islands.  Only great legends speak of what
lies on those unexplored lands.  There are men here building sea faring
vessels, and you can see a large man directing them.  These ships are
unlike any you have seen before and they seem able to withstand the
mighty ocean unlike the rafts and canoes in which you are so familiar.

Intersection of the Great Road~
You are standing at the intersection of a paved road and a dusty trail.
The paved road goes north and south.  To the north is the city of
Graecia, and to the south the road leads into the hills.  The dusty path
goes to the east and west.  To the west, the path leads to the vast
ocean and to the east the path twists into a mysterious forest.

Gateway to Graecia~
Unlike the city of Shadowdale, this city does not need any walls to
protect it.  The reputation of the Graecian soldiers is such that no
army would consider an invasion upon this fabulous city.  Beyond the
city entrance is the Main Plaza, which serves as the center of activity
for Graecia.

This is the center of activity for the town of Graecia.  You can see
artisans showing their fine works and crafts, entertainers playing their
instruments, and in a corner is a group engaged in a heated debate.
Chariots are passing through at a such rapid pace, you almost have to
actively dodge them.  To the north is the Palace and Grand Hall of the
ruler of Graecia.  To the east and west, paved roads extend throughout
the town.  As you look to the east you can see buildings built of
fine materials such as marble and obsidian, while to the west the
shadows make the road look a bit threatening.  A paved road also extends
to the south gate of town.

Grand Hall of Agamemnon~
Scholars and wise men make up the court of King Agamemnon.  You have
interupted a great debate.  As you enter the scholars recognize that you
are foreigners and hail your arrival.  King Agamemnon welcomes you to
the land of Graecia and bids you a safe journey.  He is seated on a
throne of pure gold embedded with so many jewels that the sunlight
reflected from them nearly blinds you.  You consider stealing some of
the jewels, but you realize that Agamemnon could smite you if you
angered him.  At his side, Clytemnestra, his wife, smiles
with a glint of betrayal in her eyes.  After greeting you the court
ignores you and returns to their discussion.  There are also large
columns here providing tall deep shadows and occasionally you can see a
figure dart in between them.  You realize that even the brave Agamemnon
is not without enemies and this land of Graecia is not as peaceful as it
seems.

The Dim Alley~
The paved road that you have been accustomed now takes on a different
look.  The bricks are no longer neatly laid in place, and the buildings
that you pass are progressively in worse condition.  Occassionally you
see a shadowy figure in the corner of your eyes.  Whenever you try to
catch a glimpse of the figure, it disappears into the shadows.  Your
progress to the west is blocked by a wooden wall.  You wonder why a
wooden wall is in the middle of the street, then you see some movement
behind the wall.  An arrow stikes the ground at your feet, and you
realize that that was only a warning shot.  Obviously, it would be a
good idea to leave this area quickly.

town is where the scholars and merchants live.  You can see mini
fortresses with flowing fountains and beautiful gardens latently behind
the walls of these buildings.  You would think that there would be a
crime problem in this area, but the multitude of guards in the area
suggests otherwise.  To the east is the Main Plaza and to the west the
road continues.

You have entered the grand estate of Nero.  There are fountains,
mini-colloseums, statues, and many other fine sculptures in this area.
There is a large horse seated on a throne here.  The horse prances
proudly as you enter.  For such a large estate, it seems strange that
there are not any workers scurrying around looking busy.  In fact it is
rather quiet.  Only the statues and the Horse are here to greet you.  A
man walks by and whispers that Hercules is the only worker employed by
Nero.  It must be truly a Herculean task to keep this place in order.
Paths lead in all directions into the countryside, while to the east you
can see the edges of town.

All is quiet hear..In fact all of the sounds that you are normally
accustomed to are no longer present.  To the west you can see an area
sheltered from the elements.  It seems to be a cave of a burrow of some
sort.  A strong smell of death and decay comes from the mouth of the
cave.  The wind begins to increase in force from the west and the stench
becomes overpowering.  You realize whatever is making that horrid stench
must be a formidable creature.

hear another scream, then the area is overcome by great silence.  As you
get a better look of the area you also see a small stream to the west.

blank and omnious stare.  You can see corpses of several ferocious
creatures over a large fire in the center of the village.  Obviously
they know how to use their weapons quite well.  To the south you can see
a hidden trail leading a small arbory, and to the north you can see what
appears to be a combat area.

some horrible beast, but there seems to be no sign of him now.  As you
take a second glance at the mound you see a suspicious hole concealed by
some debris.  The hole seems to be the home of some great monster, and
judging by the scales scattered around it only one thing comes to mind.
That must be the home of a DRAGON!!!

walls and ceiling of this room dont even have the chilly coating of

This is the room of Hera, wife of Zeus.  There seem to be no walls in
this room, only open scenes of several events.  All of them are focussed
on beautiful women.  In each of the scenes, the woman is being carefully
trailed and watched by a shadowy figure.  Another scene catches your eye
and it suddenly glows red.  Hera immediately looks at the scene and
begins to tremble with anger.  The scene depicts Zeus and a young woman
talking by a beautiful pond.  Suddenly Hera screams, turns towards you
and looks as if she is going to take vengeance on YOU!

on the island, you realize they are well fed.  Closer inspection of the
bones reveals that they are predominantly HUMAN!

You are surprised to find such a large island this distance away from
the mainland.  The stranger thing is that there are signs of life
everywhere you look.  To the south you see human footprints leading to a

You quickly duck for cover as an armed man passes you.  He is heading to
a huge lighthouse which is to your south.  To the west you can see the
cause for all the activity.  There is a huge fortress that rises out of
sight into the mountains on this strange island.  You can tell that this
must be the location of the pirates secret base.

that far, so can the pirates!  You try to hide in a closet as a group of
pirates enter the lighthouse, but you are too late.  They have spotted
you and rush to defend their home.

up to attack, while others flee to the south.  You can see two other

  You are standing on a trail winding through the great oak trees of the
forest of Rhowyn.  It is extremely murky and dim here, too dark to see much,
but light enough that you can tell the weather and the time.

The Begining of the Nark-An-Tor Pass~
You are entering a small dark mountian pass, unfortunatly this is the only
way through the mountians.  Wow!  It looks really dark in here.  What is

The Pass of Nark-An-Tor~
A rotting corpse lies here.  It looks to have been half eaten.  Maggots crawl
about the floor.  The body has been clawed and half eaten.  You wonder what
could have done somthing so horrible.
Other than the body you notice you are now deep within the pass.  You
can almost see light above you, high into the impassable cliffs.

The Pass of Nark-An-Tor~
You travel even deeper into the pass.  The cliff faces almost seem to close in
on you now, making the area appear to be more of a cave than a pass. The walls
here have deep gashes in them suggesting that some powerfull beast has clawed
his way up the walls.  A fresh trail of blood leads to the west.  You begin
wondering if it was such a good idea to come through here after all.

Turn in the Nark-An-Tor Pass~
Fresh blood is splattered all over the walls, decapitated limbs and half
eaten parts of human flesh are scattered about.  This kill is very fresh.
What ever did this had to have massive strength.  You see a few scattered
remains of these unfortunate souls equipment, but nothing worthwhile.  The
pass is very dark here.  You hope what ever did this doesn't come back.
Are you sure you want to continue?

The Nark-An-Tor Pass~
A as the pass leads to the north you feel a blast a air come down the thin
path. You can only hope this means you are reaching the end of this forsaken
mountian range.  But you feel you still have a ways to go.  Unusually there
is no claw marks or blood here.  All is silent, just the blowing of the wind.

Secret Passageway~
You have entered a very small cramped tunnel.  It seems to have been a natural
cave that has been carved and worked further.  The air is musty and stale.
You can hear water running to the west.

The tunnel widens up just a bit here.  There is a small pool with water rinning
through a crack in the wall into it. GASP!  HORROR!  A human body lies sprawled
out in the pool.  It's head crushed by a powerful blow.  Obvoisly taking this
tunnel did not save his life.  And you expect it wont save yours either.

The trees tower above you, and block all light, making it impossible to see
without the aid of light or magic.  You hear scurrying all around, as small
creatures rush through the undergrowth.

splashes, as if huge creatures were wandering through the swamp.  It would 
appear that there is no way to reach the swamp from here, the water is too
deep.  Perhaps you should be thankful for that!

On An Ancient Path~
    This is an ancient path. Rocks and boulders are strewn about, yet
the middle of the path shows signs of wear from the many travelers and
horses that have passed this way throughout millenia.  The path is dim,
and some light may be required up ahead. Fresh droppings from a
strange animal abound here.  It's tracks are not large, but instead,
seem claw-like. The trees nearby seem strange as well; almost lifelike.
There is an especially large tree to the west.

  Your surroundings here have become too dark to see without light or

been transformed into a well kept meandering pathway amongst well kept trees.
Something must be tending to the trees. Far in the distance to the south you
can barely make out a mountain. You might continue south, or return to the
north.

Before The Bridge~
  You find yourself before a large bridge, leading to the ugly structure.
Noise emanates from this massive compost and junk pile.  Apparently, it is
inhabited.  The structure stands, from your best estimate, at least 200 feet
high, and must be at least 300 feet long and wide.  The smell is a bit
disconscerting.

On The Bridge~
  You stand atop a rickety bridge.  There are no sides to prevent you from
falling into the muddy moat that surrounds the structure.  Bubbles burst at
the surface of the water. Something must live down there! Best make your way
quickly north or south, this bridge might not last too much longer.

however,and no metal scraps purtrude from the muddy walls. There is an

  This is an elaborately decorated meeting area for diplomats and honored

a remarkably modern room, and differs greatly from adjacent rooms.
The Skexies did notconstruct this room, and probably contracted the
services of a more civilized people in order to construct this room.
It has far too much class to have been constructed by Skexies. Items
for doing routine maintenence are strewn about.

The Skexie Counsel Room~
   This is the Counsel Chamber of the Skexies. All important decisions are
made here. This is where one Skexie might issue a challenge to another
Skexie, or where the Skexie might discuss treaties, armistices, or
declarations of war.  The large room is nearly filled by the huge
rectangle which occupies the room. The middle of the table has been
removed, leaving the table as actually a large hollow rectangle.
The walls are adorned with curtains and tapestries. This is perhaps the
richest room in all the Skexie Palace. Your most chivalrous, and
appropriate behavior is expected here.

among Skexies as the most noble Skexie to have ever lived. Rugrat is rumored
to be living in the lap of luxury somewhere nearby. Rugrat gained fame and
fortune by defeating the Shattenalfen invasion in the Year of the Dragon.
Rugrat's fighting techniques are still taught, and several Skexies are rumored
to have been taught some special secrets after training under Rugrat.

   The hallway ends here, with doors to the north and south. There nothing
particularly interesting here otherwise, except the usual feathers. In
general, the Skexie females seem a bit more concerned about hygiene than the
males. Therefore, it is a bit cleaner here than in other parts of the Palace.

Skexie Challenge Instructions Room~
   There are six signs on the wall here which explain the Challenge of the
Skexies. You are encouraged to read each of the six (Numbered "sign1" through
"sign6"), and attempt the appropriate challenge. The Challenge of the Skexies
is designed as a on-going quest. Your fair play and honesty is appreciated, as
well as expected. When you decide you are ready to try a Challenge, you will
find the entrance beyond the Skexie Lair.

     The Challenge of the Skexies is designed as an on-going
quest for people levels 10 to 50. The Challenge area is separated
into three Challenge zones. The first zone is meant for levels 10
to 20. The second for levels 20 to 40, and the last, most difficult
challenge , is meant for levels 40+. In each zone you will find 9
Challenges to be completed. After successfully completing each
challenge you will earn a badge (bronze badges for Challenge 1,
silver badges for Challenge 2, and gold badges for Challenge 3).
The badges are numbered and you must collect all the badges
(of the appropriate color) to earn the Challenge prize. There is
one prize for each class for each of the three Challenge zones
(i.e. The Warrior's prize for Challenge 3, the most difficult, is
The Purple Shard). The prizes will be well worth your risk of life.
The item you recieve _should_ be strung to your name.  If you have an
existing challenge quest item, and it has not been, ask a god to do it.
~
E
sign2~
   Players must enter each challenge room alone. The rooms are
private (i.e. One player per room), and you may not in anyway
receive help from another player. You may not attempt a challenge
unless you are in the required level range. Challenge Prizes and
badges are not tranferable, and have no monetary value. Do not attempt
to give your Challenge prizes to another player. Any such action
will cause you to lose any Challenge prize you currently have,
plus you will lose the right to complete future Challenges (if any).
To redeem your prize you must contact an Immortal with the ability
to load the prize. The prizes do not naturally exist in the game.

~
E
sign3~
   Any God which discovers you abusing the Challenge is empowered
to punish you in any reasonable way they see fit. The Challenge
of the Skexies is an innovative idea in mudding. It has never been
done before. Your full cooperation and honesty are required to
make the Challenge a fun and exciting area. The last three signs
are introductions to each of the three Challenge zones. Read them
carefully. Most of all, bring many healing potions with you.
Also, you needn't complete the entire challenge at one sitting
(the badges can be rented). Simply bypass the challenges you have
already completed, and continue with the first one that you need.

GOOD  LUCK!

It has been decreed by the High Council of the Four Caravans that trade
with the Lord of Ravenloft be cut, in an attempt to diminish his evil
power in this land. The High Lords of the Mages' Caravan created this
swamp as a boundry, to ensure that the wishes of the Council would be
heeded. If you are foolish enough to enter, beware, for death lies at
every turn. If you survive the pits of quicksand, you may still be 
caught for all eternity. If you somehow make it through our boundry, then
good luck at surviving the wrath of the Lord of Ravenloft.
                                The High Council of the Four Caravans

have a small sense of despondency when you realize that Loki fixed death
traps, and you're gonna be stark raving nude in the Temple Of Shadowdale.

A large Plain~
You are standing on a small field just north of the swamp. To the north,
you see a small path spiraling up the hills to a large castle made of
forboding granite. You can tell that it's a three story castle from this
distance, and little more. Above the castle, you see a gloomy dark cloud
that doesn't drift with the breeze. Just looking at the castle gives you
a chill. The only exits are south into the swamp, and north on the path.

breeze. You steedly make your way on the path, the silenece forboding.
A light fog coveres the ground here and seems to thicken ahead to the
north. Should you continue?

You are standing in a dark, small cave, which seems to be the lair
of some wretched creature.  Bones and fish-guts litter the room.
The stench of rotting meat, combined with the creature's own refuse,
lends a lingering odor to the room that could be best described as
mind-numbing.

Start of a Huge Golden Ladder~
You are starting a tremendous climb up a very tall ladder.  You look up ahead 
at the climb and you figure you will be climbing for a good hour before you 
even begin to reach the top.

Climbing Up a Huge Golden Ladder~
A gentle breeze blows through your hair as you continue climbing.  Its 
strange but you seem to be climbing at a very quick rate, and you dont feel 
any fatigue at all.  This must be some type of magical ladder.

Over Half Way Up a Huge Golden Ladder~
What a view!  You have climbed what must have been miles of ladder in just a 
few minutes!  You stop for a brief pause to check out the wonderfull view of 
all of Shadowdale.  The people just look like ants as you see them fighting 
each other.  Ooo there goes some type of flash, Elminster must have 
fireballed another newbie.

At the Top of a Huge Golden Ladder~
Finally you have reached the top of the ladder.  You are standing on a huge 
island floating in the sky.  A deep forest lies in front of you to the 
North.  The only other safe direction is back down the ladder, all the other 
directions are a quick way off of the island, a long plunge off of the edge.

Diving Off of the Island~
In the grand style of Greg Luganis you take a dive off the side of the island, 
plunging yourself towards the ground at an alarming speed.  Don't you wish 
you thought about it before jumping off the edge of the island now?

Your life begins to flash before your eyes as you continue your journey

All good things must come to and end, and your journey down towards the 
ground has just done so.  As you slam down hard into the ground your body 
becomes as flat as a pancake, your brains oozing out like jelly from a donut.

Entranceway Into a Grand Forest~
Huge trees tower before you, you have come across the entranceway into a 
magnificent forest, your eyes can't penetrate very deep into the forest for 
is it so lush and thick.  You can hear the calls of many wild creatures 
echoing through the air.  A dirt path leads north into the forest through the 
trees, you wonder where it could lead?  Exits in the east and west both are 
off the edge of the island.

Standing Before a Large Tree~
Towering before you is a very large tree, it seems to reach upwards and touch 
the sky.  This tree, beside from being tall, is also very thick.  A person 
could practically live inside it if they wanted to.  The path continues from 
the South to the North, and the tree blocks to exit to the West.

Entrance to the Faerie Palace~
Straight ahead you see the highest point of all the trees.  There are many
flowery vines and branches aranged to make a beautiful archway.  A very
bright glow radiates from this part of the forest.  Thus making you believe
that someone very important resides here.

You become wary when you see the many guards about.  You get the feeling you 
are close to something you aren't supposed to be at.  You are then approached
by a guard asking you your business.  Do you honestly reply, or do you take 
action?!?

kitchen staff.  Delicate tapestries hang on the walls where they may have
been hanging for hundreds of years.  A large emblem of the royal crest is 
printed on the Queen's chair.

Kitchen~
This room is very busy with activity.  Lots of servants preparing the next
meal of the day.  This room is filled with mouth-watering aromas, many 
bubbling pots and pans, and delicious desserts are resting off to the side.
Most of the dishes look almost to good to eat!  Awww...go ahead, take a 
little taste.

The Queen's Throne Room~
This is the brightest room of all.  The Grand Queen herself is majestically
minding her throne.  She is surrounded by many aides and guards.  Stunning 
scraps of color wave in the light breezes filtering through the room.  A soft
buzz of conversation is all that you hear.  Oh no!  Your presence has been
detected!

A Dark Passageway~
As you head off into this direction you notice the area getting darker and 
darker, the branches here arent as well kept up as the rest of the village 
and the leaves are starting to block out the light.  It doesnt seem as if 
many people ever go in this direction.

Tight Squeeze~
The branches get tighter and tighter together here, you have to practically 
crawl through the small opening that the leaves and branches are making.  A 
strange howling can be heard in the distance as a chill wind start to blow 
across your body.  This place is getting spooky!

Along a Dark Passageway~
The passage is a little bigger here, you have more room to move around.  The 
scenery hasnt changed at all though.  You can no longer hear the forest 
animals like you could in the village.  Deep down you know you are entering a 
bad place.

Entrance to a Shadowy Grove~
The passageway begins to open up, but the sky and ground are totally blocked 
out now, no light is able to get in.  You have entered a shadowy grove among 
the trees.  You can almost feel the forces of evil at work here.  Two large 
guards are guarding the entranceway further into the grove.  It doesnt look 
like they are too happy to see you.

A Shadowy Grove~
The branches and leaves form a huge chamber here, blocking out all light and 
sound.  The are various shelves along the walls where skulls of various 
faerie's and other forest animals lie.  A large faerie woman sits in the 
middle of the room here, she is starting into a caulron of bubbling water.  
She looks up at you as you enter.  An evil grin forms on her face and you see 
her yellow teeth.  She seems very pleased to see you here, your skulls can be 
added to her collection.

You are in a comfortable chamber.  A fireplace glows brightly on the south 
wall, lighting up the entire room.  Above the fireplace is a grand painting 
of the god Euphrates, he is in battle with the forces of good, using his 
magic to destroy all.  In the corner near the fire a huge multi-chromatic 
dragon with many heads is sleeping.  Across from the fireplace is a huge 
throne made of pure diamonds, it sparkles in the firelight.  The floor is 
covered with a red lush carpet and the walls with many tapestries.  Euphrates 
seems to enjoy a higher class of living.

   You stand at the fringe of the wilderness; east of here lies the haven 
of the walls of Mordilnia.  You can hear the life of the city, and marvel at
its size.  West of here is a humpbacked bridge, spanning the gap of a small
stream which flows endlessly through the forest.

Inside the MidWest Gate of Mordilnia~
   You are by two towers that have been built into the hard granite wall
with a strong iron gate in between; wicked, barbed spikes protruding up and
down along every other bar - like the hungry jaws of some demented 
nether-beast.
   Temple Road runs north and south from here, its dull, cobbled surface
visually muted by the windblown dust which forms a thin line over its flat
surface.  Eastward, you see the Temple of Mordilnia, in all its modest and
holy splendor.

The Temple of Mordilnia~
   The grand, marble floor of this holy house lies unscathed - though many
feet have tread its surface, both bare and shod.  The high-domed ceiling
shows a sky of many shades and hues.
   Midway from floor to ceiling, a balcony-like second floor stands, hand
woven tapestries adorning the smooth granite walls.  From here to the floor
above, a grand, spiralling stairway ascends, its polished cherrywood surface
casting a multitude of tiny daggers of reflected light into your eyes.
   Through the arched portal to the west, one can venture to Temple Road,
and the MidWest Gate, leading far out through the wilderlands.

you spy a humble temple.  To the northeast, however, a grand, majestic oak
towers above the buildings of the city.

Temple Road~
   As you walk the long, seemingly endless variety of cobblestones which
make up this road, you notice a great vision of greenery to the east.
Turning to look, you see a majestic, gargantuan tree...certainly the largest
oak you've ever seen in a largely populated area.  It's singularity seems to
make it some sort of symbolic presence, like a talisman of ultimate nature
grasped cruelly in the stony talons of society.
   The road continues from here, both to the north and the south.

toward the town wall, and the jewelry shop above.  Glancing westward, you
see a gate leading out of town, while the scenery of the east flows toward
the center of Mordilnia, and a bit past it.
   The sounds of a forge can be heard nearby, and you wince at the deafening
revertebrations of the hammer as it meets the anvil, sending a ringing sound
through the streets, a sound not unlike that of heavy weaponry clashing
furiously in battle.

the building seemingly levitating in mid-air.  Upon closer inspection,
however, you see that the building is built into the top of the wall
surrounding Mordilnia, with a strong, steel frame stairway leading up to the
front door of the establishment.
   Though the cobbled stone street here is shadowed by the building above it,
the stones have an almost supernatural polished gleam to them, as if
advertising the wares bought and sold daily just atop the stair...

impression of a fiery dragon's lair.  The floor is constructed of cobbled
stone, some of which has been worked loose over the years.  A large
assortment of armours and weapons hang from the walls here, and a giant
cauldron of cool, steel-quenching water lies in the center of the room,
waiting to extinguish the metal's heat.

of establishments and small villas lining the streets.
   Diamond Street leads west from here, Blackraven Avenue leads east, and
Phantom Road leads south.  To the north, Wizard Way leads to the North Gate,

drunken gossip and rest from adventure.  The hardwood floor is finely
polished and still shines, though many heeled boots have tried to scar its
surface in the past.  The building is illuminated by many small candles
hanging from oaken pillars, giving the room a warm, cheery glow.  Many
tables are sitting around the room, and a long, oaken bar sits against the
far wall.

candelabras which hold herb-scented, multicolored candles of a respected
and lovely craft.  Vast, almost limitless tomes containing holy knowledge
fill countless shelves, as well as statuettes depicting deities of every
pantheon and creed.
   At the front of the shop, for that is the true purpose of this otherwise
saintly abode, sits a small, mahogany desk scarred by many years of loving
use by quill and scroll.

At the southern edge of the stage, you see a podium, its ebony surface a
grim testament to the death which has been dealt here.
   In the center of the wooden stage, a guillotine stands, solemnly waiting
for its wicked blade to bite into flesh and bone.  Spectators of past
decapitations have always gasped at the meaty thump of a severed head
falling into the blood-lined interior of the bucket below.
   East of here, you see Phantom Road.  East Avenue runs south into South
Street from here, and oddly enough, you see an oak tree shading the grass of
the Town Common to the west.

past loungings, such as soft indentations in the grass where someone has
briefly taken seat for lunch or small talk.  Small, wild flowers grow in
dense, well-distributed patches throughout the common, giving you a picture
of simplistic beauty.
   A great, towering oak resides west of here, shading that part of the
common and providing an adequate place of slumber.  The only irony to these
sights is the existance of the sadistic tool of death just east of here, a
great chopping block for those of unruly nature.

At The Great Oak~
   You stand at the thick base of the gargantuan Great Oak.  Its trunk is as
thick as any building in Mordilnia, a testimony to its great age.  None of the
inhabitants know how or why it is here, but some have guessed that it was
planted millennia ago by a wisened race of Druidic creatures, as a legacy of
their passing, and some traveller set up camp at its base, eventually deciding
to stay, building Mordilnia as a whole around this central figurehead of
nature and beauty.  No one has dared bring blade against this tree, for some
unspoken law, or perhaps a Druidic ritual, has forbade it.
   The Town Common lies east of here, shaded by the branches of the oak, while
the Temple Road is to the west.

floats through the air here, for your vision blurs and colors change; from
magenta to fuscia, to every visible color imaginable.
   The sign of the shop to the north seems to waver and dance writhingly, and
the cobbled stones beneath your feet seem to shift restlessly, as if they
were tiny, sentient beings, set on carrying your weight with only their sheer
size in numbers.  Then a fresh wind tugs at your face and through your hair,
and all is normal in the world once again.

be located in the back somewhere, with a ventillation shaft extanding above
the shop.
   Here, you see strange, arcane symbols attached to the walls here and there
along with shelves full of bottled liquids and jarred powders.  A large,
stone-carved counter lies in the center of the room, with neatly stacked
papers and other secretarial paraphanelia lining its top.

The Guild Roads~
   You are standing at the beginning of a mazelike procession of streets,
which contain and are compromised of all the guilds of every profession.
   The odd construction of these roads has never been fully understood...as
if some deranged architect were put to the task of designing a trap of
knowledge for the unwary.

The Guild Roads~
   Walking along the cobbled stone street, with the wind whipping through
your hair, you notice a lone Knight standing before a majestic oaken door
to the south.  The road leads east and west, but stops in either
direction.  You feel boxed in for some unspecified reason...

The Guild Roads~

Roads.  You wonder why the roads were not constructed as one, with the
various guilds lining it, instead of its current configuration.
   The road continues both to the west and the south, and you see the
entrance to the Warriors' Guild to the southwest.

Inside the SouthEast Gate of Mordilnia~
   You stand at the SouthEast gate of Mordilnia, a heavy oaken portal with
overlapping iron bands for reinforcement.  It stands nearly three men tall,
and looks to be a cumbersome thing to open.  Looking closely at its surface,
you see that it has been hacked in several places, as if someone from the
inside were trying to get out.
   The Guild Roads continue north and south of here, the northern stretch
turning westward as does the southern end.

brute strength and instinct, a guild of people who revel in hacking the life
out of their adversaries.
   The roof above you is made of finely polished ceramic tile, while the
walls are made of a hard, granite-like substance.  The southern door, which
leads into the main room itself, is crafted of a sturdy wood which has been
sanded and finished to a gleaming shine.  On either side of the door, exquisite
marble columns as big around as an average sized tree hold up the ceiling
above your head, so beautiful and yet so stonily strong and cold.

large urn filled with exotic incense and dried spices.  The smoke and its
pleasant odor do not fill you with dull, meditative thoughts.  Rather, they
sharpen your senses, hone your instincts...make you slightly paranoid.
   Instruments of the thieving trade line the walls and rest upon tables
throughout the room, but you can tell they are not of high-quality; mere
toys for trainees.  All is quiet here, as is the way of the silent and
sure thief.

circle of summoning.  Large portriats of past mages unleashing powerful
dweaomercraeft upon their foes hang on the walls, as do strange words of advice

edged swords and serrated blades, as well as huge axes of war and weapons
designed to literally crush the life out of one's opponent are carefully,
and almost lovingly cleaned and displayed in museum-fasion in glass cases
and velvet-lined chests.  Large, bulky suits of armor rest on quilted tables
and crates, as well as some that have been put up on display.
   The room is strangely clean, though that is due to the fact that if it
were not, weapons and armor both would go to ruin in a dry heap of crimson
rust and corrosion.

as their branches interlock.  You neither see or hear any wildlife in this

shadows over everything around.  The path continues southward, over a bridge,

From here you can look upstream toward Shadowdale and see where the river
emerges from under the city wall.  The water, cold and dark, rushes through
the narrow channel created by the bridge and the large stones that have
fallen from the pilings.  The wood looks rotted and groans loudly with
every step.  On the south side of the bridge the road rises suddenly up a
steep bank.

ruts and large stones make you stumble.  A bit further south is the river,
you can hear it from here.

Wide Way Through the Forest~
   You are traveling a rather wide path along the forest edge west of
Shadowdale.  The path is actually the remains of an old road that once carried
trade to and from the southern parts of the continent.
   Few people travel this way nowadays... too dangerous.

The Cavernous Lair of The Mighty Skylar~
   You stand within the dark recesses of a gargantuan, sinister cavern of
immense proportions.  The very size of the place seems to create a darkness
which devours nearly all light which is cast at its gloom.  Cold, stale air
floats trough the air, its dead, sterile taste making you have thoughts of
ancient, dusty-dry tombs.
   Huge stalagmites and stalactites protrude from the floor and ceiling of
the cavern, formed over millennia by the constant, miniscule trickle of chill,
stagnant water from a source far up on the surface lands.  In the distance, the
roar of a mighty waterfall can be heard, though it can not be seen from here,
its chilling mists somehow grasp hold of your flesh, like dead, clammy hands,
even from this distance.  You can feel an ancient, omnipotent power at work
here.  It is not one of evil, or even that of good.  It is a power known
throughout the ages, yet forgotten, or cast aside, like a bane of ill tidings.

A Leader Strand~
     This strand is weightier, more sturdy.  It shimmers as you step on
it.  You are definitely not in the Shadowdaleian realms anymore.  Just
where you are you can't tell.  It feels like you're moving through
ether.  You can still get back down to more surer lands.

lying about.  You feel that humans have been played with here too,

South Chapel of the Temple~
You are at the south end of the great temple. It is bedecked
with many ancient symbols and artifacts. The strange thing about
this temple is that unlike the rest of the city it seems to be
quite well kept. An exit lies to the south and the main hall
lies to the north.

Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still visible through the grass that
seems to have grown up through the cracks everywhere. Even so, it is an
impressive monument to the civilization that built it. There is a light desert
to the west, to the east is a grassland that extends to the horizon. To the
north and south the road extends to the limit of your vision, north through
the grassland, south to a large mountain range.

rather than going around or over it, it goes right through it, giving you an
even greater respect for the civilization that built it.

caused you to start wondering; who could have built this road? how long ago?
what great cities did it connect? The answers must have been lost to modern
lore, or surely in your travels you would have heard some rumor of this place.
The road marches on through the hills, flat, straight, north and south.

Winding Path~
    After the easy walk on the ancient road it takes you a little time to get
used to the rough going on this winding trail. The grass and brush has had more
success reclaiming its territory here than it did there, and you find yourself
having to push the vegatation aside at times to get through. The trail is
continually rising, and you find yourself nearer to the mountains to the south
in elevation, if not in actual distance. The track continues east and west.

Path End~
    You have come to the end of the winding path, and only now discover who
must have used it aeons ago. You are on top of a particularly tall hill, one
that gives an excellent view of the grassy plains and desert below. Far to
the north you see a glint of blue that can only be the ocean. It is there the
road must have been headed. There is an area of scorched earth here that has
withstood all the wind and rains, from an uncountable number of campfires kept
by the watchmen who once stayed here. The winding path leads back down the
hill to the east.

straight white line that the ancient road makes through the landscape. Far in
the distance to the north you can see a blue expanse that must be an ocean,
while nearer it turns into a sea of green, which extends to the east to the
edge of your vision. To the north-west you can see the desert, an you think
you can just see the outlines of a triangular structure in the center. To the
north the sheer faces of the cliffs are now very close, and the trail seems
to be taking you right to them.

A Rocky Precipice~
    The trail you've been following ends here on a wide ledge. Long ago, it
must have been lookout used to view the world below. The mountains rise
straight above you, the sheer rock face forming an impassable barrier to
further travel in that direction. To the west you can see a fissure in the
rock; one that is deep enough that you can't see how far it extends. You know
better than to try to get there from here, though, as it would involve scaling
the mountain going west for more than twenty feet, and you'd never make it. The
steep trail heads back down the mountain here, giving you an exit.

    As you grasp the rock you look into a fissure that extends several feet
into the face, getting deeper as it continues up the mountain. Looking out
from the fissure reveals a rocky precipice you could probably reach if you had
wings, but certainly not without. It is very cool in here, as the sun rarely
reaches the recesses of this crack. You figure you can work your way up the
fissure to leave. No other exits are apparent.

    You have entered a natural cavern, formed by the forces of nature over

no one has entered this cavern in ages, if anyone has ever been here at all.
The cave is completely dark aside from your light, the stalagmites cast strange
shadows on the walls around you. In one corner of the room you notice a hole
in the floor of the cave. Extending your light into it reveals it to be leading
into a space whose size is impossible to tell - the floor and walls, if any,

you have the time you will return to work the rock. In the meantime, you can go
south and west to other parts of the cavern, or north to the extended cave.

What you can see of it appears to be moving. Very odd. From the blackness of
whatever it is that is up there, you think it might be bats. Of course, that
would mean there are lots of them. As this occurs to you, it also strikes you
that it might be a good idea to leave. Like, now.

which merged into a single stream. The southern route was clearly the larger
of the two sources, as the tunnel there is only slightly smaller than the one
into which the two sources converge to the north. The other source looks
like it probably was a minor tributary, as the hole through which it enters
this tunnel is barely large enough to fit through. It leads up and to the

on the northern wall which disappears into the inky blackness above. It doesn't

your hands to brace yourself against the rock and slide up or down on the

In the Icy Pool~
    You are swimming in a small pool. Unfortunately, the water is extremely
cold. As a matter of fact, you can feel hypothermia coming on quite rapidly.
Perhaps it would be a good idea to get out and dry off. You can exit to the
west to the edge of the pool, or the south to the funnel.

Edge of the Icy Pool~
    You are on the western edge of a small pool filled with icy water. To the
east and north the sheer walls of the mountain serve both to prevent passage
and to channel the flow of the water that collects on the slopes into this
pool. When the pool fills, the overflow goes over a small natural dam on the
south end of the pool into the funnel just south of it. You can go south to
the edge of the funnel from here, and also east for a dip in the pool.

Edge of Sinkhole~
    You are on the western edge of a natural sinkhole. There are boot tracks
here that have solidified in the mud. The tracks lead to the north, where you
can see an icy pool. Probably a water stop for the trail up the mountain you
notice to the west. To the east is a natural sinkhole, at the bottom of which
you can see a dark opening leading to who knows where.

more of a leisurely stroll. The wind that had been whipping down the path has
lessened now, and without it the bitter cold of past traveling has given way
to more moderate chilly temperatures. You can go down the path to the north,
up to the south, and there is also a small trail leading to the east.

here now, however, and from the musty smell you estimate it must have been
that way for some time. The floor of the tunnel is covered with a gritty sand
that results from aeons of small pebbles traveling along the stream grinding
against the rocky tunnel floor. The route continues to the north and south.

Rock Face~
    You have emerged from the narrow tributary path onto a sheer mountain
face. The wind whips by you here at an alarming rate, and you cling desperately
to the rock to avoid being torn from your perch and blown to your death on the
rocks thousands of feet below. From here you can see a running stream a few
hundred feet down the cliff face to the east, where it disappears into another
crevice in the rock on its path to unknown destinations. From the lay of the
land about you it doesn't take long to figure out that the water flowing there
once flowed here, thus explaining the dry bed you've been following. The only
exit for those without wings (or the equivalent) is back down into the rock
face.

swimming rather walking along the bottom. There are a few blind fish darting
about; they are more concentrated to the south and west. They don't seem to
like your light source very much, and move away when you come close. There is
a fairly strong current pulling you to the east. You can also exit up to the
lake surface, west and south to other parts of the lake, and down into a small
hole leading to unknown destinations.

An Underwater Cave~
    Perhaps coming in here wasn't such a good idea. The temperature of the
water in what has turned out to be a small underwater cave is a few degrees
warmer than the chillier water of the lake proper. Perhaps that is why some
rather large and nasty predators have taken this to be their home. Unlike the
lake bottom, the underwater cave is rocky, and along the floor you can make
out a layer of bones whose depth isn't easily determinable. There is a crack
in the south wall out of which the warmer water flows, but it is too small for
passage. If you survive, you can exit to the north.

the other side out of which warmer water is emitted more slowly. You could
probably get into the smaller crack, but the force of the current out of the
larger makes travel through it impossible. The current is pulling you to the

Old River Bed~
    You are sweating a bit under your armor now, as the temperature in this
dry river bed is excruciatingly hot. It isn't hard to see why, either, as the
white sand along on the river bed reflects the sunlight back off the cliffs
that rise above you to the east and west. The breeze you had noticed before
has disappeared as mysteriously as it came, leaving the area in a sweltering
calm. This place is even hot at night! You can exit north and south along the
river bed.

Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it as they have where it is exposed to the
open sky. You have entered the arching tunnel mouth, which towers above your
head impressively. It is still possible to see here, from the light coming in
through the tunnel entrance. The road continues straight and level into the
heart of the mountains; no end is visible from here, as it is shrouded in
darkness a few hundred feet beyond your current position.

the gradual reduction of light from the entrance to nearly nothing - it is now
only a small semi-circle of light in the distance to the north. At this point,
only your light source allows you to see. The road, however, continues as
before; straight, flat, and servicable for travel.

broken arrows and a few other miscellaneous broken items. They look like they
were heading north, although it's hard to tell for sure. Clearly, whoever these
people were, they have been dead for a very long time~

skeleton skeletons bones~
They have been completely stripped, and are now quite brittle with age. The
smaller one looks like it probably belonged to a humanoid female, the larger
to a humanoid male. Possibly a husband and wife. The bones of the male are
broken in a few places.

impossible to see an exit to the north or south, and you are now too far into
the passage for the elements to reach in any form. As a result, the air is
stale and unpleasant. It only becomes more so to the south, though it is better
to the north.

weary travelers many an age ago. The road continues to the north and south;
it is flat and smooth, shooting straight through the mountain's heart.

as far as your light can tell you. You sense the oppressive weight of millions
of tons of rocks hanging over your head, and marvel again at those who made
this road so long ago.

    Abruptly, the road ends here in a tremendous cave-in to the south. It isn't
clear how long ago the earth shifted and the roof of the tunnel collapsed, but
it is clear that no further travel to the south is possible this way. You spot
a few bones and pieces of broken equipment here, and the shadows your light
casts off the large stones among those that block your passage seem to dance
and flicker evilly. You have a strong urge to flee.

Ambush!~
    Well, you've found an explanation for the broken bones. A party of
well armed troglodytes have marked your travel down the road and have been
waiting patiently for you to arrive. They seem to have come from a small hole
in the west wall you hadn't noticed before, as it was partially hidden by one
of the large rocks that has fallen from the ceiling.

you are going to be lunch. You notice a lot of broken bones on the floor here,
and there are some partially drained troglodyte corpses up in the webbing that

about the dirty floor, personal things of the cave's occupant - a large and
particularly evil looking troglodyte. The conditions he is living in are
pitiful, and you turn your nose in disgust at the remains of a rotted tunnel
rat that he discards as you enter. Looks like he's found a more appetizing

west, you might have stumbled upon a troglodtye settlement. There are several
large troglodyes here will be glad to show you around. Well, they might be

dried blood from the less successful of those tutored here. Apparently they
play-fight awfully rough. The broken weapons and scraps of armor lying about

quite apparently the cooking area for the troglodytes living around here.
There are a few pots and pans here, though they are barely recognizable as
such. The small fire under the pot from which that yummy rat smell is being
emitted is barely enough to see by, but you can detect some troglodyte matrons
slaving over the cookery. They seem to think you'd make a nice addition to the
meal they're preparing. There is an exit to the south, and you hear what might

ground is more or less even, but the passage walls are so similar in kind that
it is impossible to differentiate one passage from another by them. There are
exits leading in all four compass directions. The tunnel floor has been worn
smooth by the passage of many feet.

Caves of the Troglodytes~
    This is the entrance of a large cave, that extends to the west and then
branches out further to the north. It is likely that you have found the
beginning of the main troglodyte community, as they are quite numerous here.
>From their reaction to you, you'd think they are of the opinion you are
invading their privacy or something. There are two exits - east back into the
tunnels, and west, deeper into the caves.

Caves of the Troglodytes~
    You are in the southeasternmost arc of a large cave shaped approximately
like a donut, with an extremely large column in the center of the cavern. The
diameter of the column, you estimate, is probably about two-thirds of that of
the cave itself. It makes for a very strange tunnel-like effect, but it looks
natural though you have no idea what force of nature might have caused it.
This is where the troglodytes hone their weapons and repair their armor. From
the looks of things, it appears as if it's a skill they've been working on for
some time; though their tools are limited their armor and weapons are in
excellent shape. Maybe the Repair Guy had some troglodyte blood, who knows?
As you enter the cave, the many troglodytes working in here eye your armor and
weapons appreciatively.

Caves of the Troglodytes~
    This is the northeastern cave of a linked set of four caves, which could
also be characterized as a single cave with an awfully big column in the
center.  From what you can tell, the cave is shaped more or less like a big
donut. In this section of the cave, female troglodytes are working on
extracting those vital vitamins and minerals from recent kills, by crushing
the bones into a powder which gets mixed into an occasional meal. There are
a couple of young trogs running around here, annoying those working. All this
activity ceases when you enter, and they turn to the task of defending their
home. In addition to the exits along the cave to the west and south, there is
also a passage leading north.

entirely unlit normally, and the presence of your light source appears to be
the brightest thing some of the little trogs have ever seen. Again, it strikes
you that you might be trespassing. There is a larger cave off to the south,
and there are also cavern to the north and west.

    This is a smaller cave than any of the others in this area. It appears to
be a hidden twin strongpoint to the one directly east of here, from which the
cave you are currently in is not clearly visible. Ordinarily, this position
would be occupied by troglodytes watching over the other strongpoint to the
east, preparing to reinforce them in case of any trouble.

you think you've ever seen, for a cave. It looks like the place has been
cleaned with a toothbrush... even the dirt on the cave floor looks clean. The
rocks are shiny and sparkle at you, hinting at worth in their glittering
cleanliness, even though you know they are without value. There are ordinarily
several female troglodytes here, in serious discussion.

    This large cave is the sleeping quarters of most of the male troglodytes,
a fact that is evinced more than anything by the bad smell and the large mess.
How so many creatures who don't believe in bathing could live together in one
room is beyond comprehension. Perhaps troglodyes have no sense of smell. This
place is such a mess, you imagine they must have bad vision, too, to tolerate
it. The cave is normally occupied by a few troglodyte soldiers, catching a nap
between guard duties.

    The cave you are in resembles a tunnel more than anything, and might be
labeled as such if it weren't so wide. In fact, though, you are in a cavern
with an extremely large column of natural stone in the middle, which blocks
the view of the other side of the cavern from your current position. This part
of the cave is a practice area for adult troglodytes, as there are scraps of
metal and wood scattered about the floor in silent testimony to past rites of
supremacy that determine the clan chief. There are exits to the north, south,
and east.

    You are now in the northwest arc of a large, donut shaped cave. This is
likely the place where the soldiers work out ther strategy and formations, as
you can see a bunch of rocks set on a stone "table" (really just a large, flat
rock), ostensibly the staging grounds for mock battles and strategic plots by
troglodytes here for many a year, given how smooth the top has now been worn.
There are also several crude drawings on the wall, though what they are of, it
is hard to say for sure. The cave continues to the south and east, and there
are also passageways leading to the west and north.

    This is the chief's "private" cave. Apparently being the leader of these
people has some priveledges, at least. The caves furnishings are only slightly
more ornate here than anywhere else, though, so apparently the job isn't
exactly loaded with perks. The chief is here, talking with his top fighters
about prospects of battle. They turn to you, knowing now the battle they had
been anticipating is already upon them. There is an exit to the east.

guests. There is a large case filled with trophies from past victories of the
troglodyte clan. Among the trophies, you spot a battered Golden Shield, the
skull of a cave fisher, with some dents and a big hole just over the right
eye, a small crystal sphere, and dull grey helmet with a plume that was once
probably white. The mementos here range from the unexpected to the astounding.
You are impressed by the ability of such a seemingly limited people to have
defeated such a large and varied set of opponents. You can exit east~

    The end of the mountain trail is evident to your west from here; the trail
drops steeply and the ground turns greener, as the elevation isn't sufficient
to maintain the ice and snow of the higher ground. A freezing wind blows down
the mountains through which this trail winds, and it makes you shiver in your
boots. The mountain trail leads to the south from here up and up again the
mountain heights. You can also go west to more moderate climes.

    The trail turns again here, as it makes its way up and around the peaks
the have started to appear around you in all directions. Though the path
doesn't assault any actual peaks, you notice that the elevation here is
significantly higher than it is to the north, and it rises even further as it
continues it's journey to the east, since it moves of the valley floor up
along the side of a mountain. Up until now, the snow that has been adorning
the mountains was higher up, but you have come to the point where the trail
winds through the snow. Still, it is compact enough to permit travel, though
the way is a bit slipperier.

    It is bitterly cold here. The snow on the path is about ankle deep here,
and it's fresh, which makes traveling on it a bit of a trial. The path is now
making its way along a mountainside, rather than trying to slither between the
peaks at their bases. As a result, to the south there is an impressive drop to
the valley floor far below. Fortunately, the path is wide enough to afford
easy travel without worrying about slipping to one's death below. The grade is
quite steep going up to the east, though to the west the trail leaves the
mountainside on it's way down to warmer places. An icy wind blows from the
southeast, chilling you to the bone.

    The trail curves along the side of a mountain here, leading to the west

below you, you can see lesser peaks to the north. You are above them, and you
can see they are just below the constant cloudline that glooms menacingly on
the trail leading south into the mountains above you. The snow is still
shallow enough here for reasonable travel, though it is fresh, and your feet
sink into up to the top of your ankles. Unfortunately, it looks as if it only
gets deeper to the south, where the trail rises further. The wind is strong
here, and it claws at your clothing, penetrating it to make you long for warmer
climes.

Mountain Trail~
    Your ears pop, and it is difficult to breathe normally here, as the
elevation makes for a scarcity of oxygen in the atmosphere. You hope to leave
this place soon, as the elements are starting to wear on you. It is snowing
lightly here, and the fresh snow on the ground makes travel difficult, as each
step is a labor in which you submerge your feet into the knee deep snow and
extract them again to plod on. Adding to the unpleasantness is a wind that you
are really starting to resent, blowing down from the the south. Visibility is
restricted here by the cloud cover, so it is impossible to tell how much
further the trail rises before it breaks through the worst part of mountains.
You can go up to the south, or down to the north.

    The trail drops into a small crevice here, as it makes it's way up the
side of yet another immense peak. You can't tell how far up you are for sure,
but given the practically waist deep snow and the difficulty you are having
breathing, it is higher then humanoids were built to travel for very long. The
nice thing about the crevice is that it prevents the wind from doing further
damage to you, for a while at least. The snow here is on the heavy side; large
flakes now fall around you silently. The crevice turns to the east, leading
ever upward, and to the north it returns to the lands below.

    To say it is snowing here would be an understatement. It is snowing
*hard*, and combined with the strong cold wind the weather here could almost
be characterized as a blizzard. You have to bend over to present as little
surface as possible to the constant force of the wind. The mountain trail is
now covered in hip deep snow and distinguishable only because the mountains to
the north and east and southwest prevent passage in those directions. You can
barely breath, and the instant crystalization of what little air you expel
tells you that continued travel here may be a fatal mistake. To the extent the
trail is visible, it leads to down the mountain to the west and up further
still to the south.

    You are in a full force blizzard, travelling along a narrow pass near the
top of the peaks in a vast mountain range. You can just see the outlines of
the pinnacles of the mountains to your east and west, and the ground seems to
have entirely flattened out, though it is hard to be sure with the gale force
wind buffeting you about and blowing snow in your eyes. It is nearly
impossible to breathe here, the air is so thin. You are now practically
swimming in snow, and the exertion is exhausting you. The mountain path leads
further south, and to the north, where the trail descends.

Snowy Pass~
    The wind screams in your ears here, as you enter a narrow mountain pass
at the very apex of the mountain range. From what little you can tell in the
driving snow, the trail drops in elevation to the south, though it flattens
out to the north. Unfortunately, the further south you go, the deeper the snow
gets. Eventually, it reaches eye level, and you realize that further passage
in this direction is impossible. The prospects of making your way to the north
are not particularly attractive, but further travel to the south is right out,
since wading through snow above your head would certainly result in a frozen,
self-performed burial.

The gentle hills to the west become steeper to the east, which is the way the
trail continues, in addition to it's sojourn through the dryer valley to the
north. You can see the great eastern desert stretching off to the northwest
from here, as you look in that direction a pyramidical shape is evident. To

size. Probably a city or something.

in that direction. The landscape here is dotted with brown brush and other dry
weather foliage, though as you look to the south things get a bit greener,
probably the result of runoff from an extensive mountain range that has become
visible to the southeast. From here, you can see the whitecaps standing starkly
against the clear sky. The trail to the south looks like it's headed that way,
as the trail has a pronounced rise in that direction. You can also go west to

on the east is abated. In that direction, through a split in the cliff walls,
you can see a path winding its way through a dry hilly valley. To the west,
the trail rises up a series of switchbacks up the face of the cliff, probably
emerging somewhere in the great eastern desert above. The river bed also
continues to the north. It is very hot here.

traveled, but given the amount of the dust on the floor, it is clear that like
the road itself, it has been unused for ages. There are sconces in the walls
for torches, but none are there now - your light source provides the only
illumination. You can exit east to the ancient road, or west, where the tunnel
enters a larger area that once served as a common area.

    This is a sizeable room, approximately square in shape, and almost two

that a natural cave was enlarged to create the space you currently occupy.
The ground is flat, and unadorned. Once upon a time, weary travelers pitched
their tents here to rest before continuing on to their destination. There are
no signs of recent use, however. There are openings in the walls of this room
in all four compass directions, though your light source isn't powerful enough

rock, as the sharpness of the corners and smoothness of the rock rules out the
possibility of any natural cause for its formation. Little remains of the
stables themselves, as the wood that was used to separate the animals has
mostly rotted to dust. What remains is broken and useless for its original

in the southwestern corner of the room. No water flows there now. There are
also stone biers jutting out of the floor in four rows, upon which foodstuffs,
mount feed, and other supplies could have rested. Nothing remains of whatever
supplies were once kept here. There are two exits; back to the commons to the

Ancient Road~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still in very good shape here, as the
elements have not been able to abuse it here as they have where it is exposed
to the open sky. The ancient road continues to the north and south, straight
as ever in its course. The rock walls and smooth, and the stones along the
floor are flat and even, though worn from the passage of countless travelers,
long ago.

towards the opening, or north, deeper into the mountain.

The Northern Gate to the Kingdom of Rhyodin~
    Long ago, this road must have been a thoroughfare, as it is easily forty
feet across. The stones that form it are still visible through the grass that
seems to have grown up through the cracks here and there, nourished by the
light that comes through the tunnel entrance to the south. The mouth where the
road enters the mountain here is blocked by a series of crosshatched bars of
a strange black metal. Each bar is a little less than two inches in width, and
they are spaced two feet apart, creating a square grid through which you can
see the countryside beyond. In the center of this is a gate, easily twenty feet
across and high, of the same crosshatched material, set into a rectangular
metal frame. There is no apparent lock on the gate.

You see a serene valley, with a clear blue sky and large green fields. Far
to the south you see a town, and further south you think you see the outlines
of a large castle. Apparently the mountain range you have just come through
completely surrounds this valley, because you can make out mountains forty
miles to the south, and more mountains on the east and west. They seem to
form a complete circle about the unspoilt valley you see before you.

Barracks~
    This room once clearly served as a military barracks, where men (certainly
some kind of humanoid, from the shape of the bunks) would sleep and spend some
of their free time. There are several rows of bunks here, stacked two high for
efficiency. At the foot of each is a locker, most of which hang open, some of
which are twisted and battered - apparently from attempts of would-be looters.
The barracks continue to the west and south.

The Gatehouse~
    This area served as a checkpoint for those entering the outpost from the
outside. There is an extremely large and imposing-looking gate to the east.
In times of old it must have served to guard the outpost from any opposition
forces. It shows no signs of damage, on this side, at least, so perhaps it was
never needed to fulfill that purpose. It has a large, complicated  locking
mechanism, which even the most competent thief would turn green trying to pick.
There is a passage to the west, and the gate stands to the east, leading to
unknown destinations.

    The purpose of the long flat beds you noticed from the corridor is clearer
now that you can get a better look at them, as is the purpose of the cabinets.
The beds are on rollers, and from what you can see in the cabinets that are
open, they are filled with linens and bandages. This room was once a medical
facility, but a thick layer of dust has settled over everything as the ages
passed, removing any sterility this room might have once had. Among the
furniture here are several open storage cabinets, and a couple closed ones.
There is nothing else of interest. There is an exit to the west.

Mustering Square~
    This is the largest artificially created area you've seen down here
underneath the mountain.  Once upon a time, it was a assembling grounds for
the troops getting ready to go out to battle. As you hold your light aloft,
you can barely see the roof where a large, broken sphere once provided light
to the grounds. There are wide openings to the east and west, and narrower
tunnels lead to the north and south. From here it is impossible to tell where
any of these exits lead.  The dust on the floor here is uneven - possibly this
area has been disturbed by someone or something since it was vacated ages ago.

Bath~

are six open pits in the stone floor, each around four feet deep and six or so
feet diameter, that served as tubs for those trying to rid themselves of dirt.
There are small channels cut into the floor, an offshoot from the main
channel, which extends from a small hole in the south wall, leads up each of
the six pits. Because all the tubs are currently dry, and look to have been so
for some time, you can see that at the bottom of each pit there is a small
opening as well. Ostensibly, water flowed through the channels, into the tubs,
and drained out through the holes. The engineering of this room impresses you

They are narrow gutters in the floor of the room through which water flowed
from the inlet hole in the south wall to the tubs. The main one is about three
inches deep, the others are only an inch or two in depth.

It's pretty small, but by shining your light down it you can tell that it

It's about four feet deep and six feet in diameter. It is now empty, but once
water entered through the channels and left through a small hole in the bottom.
These pits were carved from the stone, they were not naturally formed.

Recreation Room~
    The troops of this place apparently knew how to have a good time, as well
as to drill and fight. This rec room has a pool table, two dartboards, and a
couple of chess and checker boards sitting on the tables. Unfortunately, there
aren't any queues, darts, or complete sets to actually play the games anymore.
Best of all, there is a bar in the back, which looks like it still has some
bottles.

You could use it as a shield if it had some kind of handle. But unfortunately,

Stairs~
    The stairs lead both up and down from here - this place is bigger than you
thought! Given what you have seen so far, you have come to the conclusion that
at one time it served as some kind of military post. From the cut of the stone
and the size of the place, you'd guess whoever made it was humanoid. And from
the musty smell in the air and the dust on the ground, it seems likely this
place is at least a couple centuries old. Who made it, and who they were
defending themselves against, remains a mystery. You can go up or down the
stairs, or exit on this level to the east.

Mess Hall~
    There are a lot of long, flat tables here, lending credence to your initial
guess that this room served as a cafateria for the troops. This room is quite
large, and the roof is higher than most of the other parts of the outpost. It's
hard to say for sure, but it looks like the cafeteria continues on to the west.
There is also an opening in the south wall, and one in the east wall that looks
like it leads back to the hallway.

    This is the western end of a large cafeteria the troops of this outpost
once used to feed their faces in. The heavy layer of dust over all the metal
tables and benches makes it very unlikely it has been used for this function,
or any function, for that matter, in the last few centuries, at least. The
roof here is fairly high, as it is in the cafeteria section to the east, which
is the only exit from here.

Kitchen~
    Two large ovens dominate this room, along with the stove that occupies the
room's center. There are large iron pots all over the stove, and there are
several shelves and drawers in the cabinets along the walls that have other
kitchen utensils. The ovens are what draw your attention, though. They are
both along the south wall, but are so large as to stick out several feet into
the kitchen's center. They are about ten feet tall, and tower above you
impressively. They look like they would be capable of feeding an army, which
is good, because apparently that's what they did. There are two exits; east
through a small door to a hallway, and north to the mess hall.

Practice Yard~
    This half of the practice yard must have been used for more advanced
training than in the yard to the east.  That would be your guess, anyway,
because you can't really tell how the stuff in here operates well enough to
assess what it was used for. There is one contraption with several pieces of
wire tied at varying heights between two tall, flexible wooden poles. There is
also an area where the floor is covered by a strange flexible material, which
deforms and sinks when you put weight on it. Plus, there's a large, flat piece
of wood with several holes drilled in various places all over it. Other, even
stranger devices make you scratch your head in wonder. The practice yard
continues to the east, which is the only exit.

Supply Room~
    This room was evidently used for the storage of foodstuffs, travelling
equipment, clothing, boots, soap, and other necessities of military life. It
looks as if the room has been ransacked thoroughly by someone or something, as
all of the crates, once stacked in rows for easy access, are now scattered
about the room, ripped open and revealing what little contents that still
remain. Of the food, only a couple empty tins indicate that iron rations were
once stored here - there are none here now. All the crates have been opened,
but apparently not everything the looters discovered was of value to them. You
can leave west.

the racks and hooks the weapons used hang on, for there isn't a single weapon
remaining here now. Whoever looted this room did a very thorough job. From the
dust on the floor you can tell that no one has entered this room for some
time. Possibly, when the last of the weapons were taken, all reason to do so
was eliminated. You can leave to the west.

    This is a small cell, surrounded by granite walls that look quite solid.
It is quite chilly here, as the stone walls seem to radiate a coldness that
makes you wrap your arms around yourself for warmth. The cell has a bed made
of stone hanging off the south wall, and a very small hole in the southwest
corner for waste disposal. There is a set of iron bars to the north; through
them is the only exit.

Hallway~
    This is the north end of a hallway. The hall leads south as far as your
light source will show you. The stone here is obviously cut - this is no
natural passage but the work of some intellegent species. Given the size and
orthagonality of the doorways and dimensions of the passages, you estimate
that they were probably humanoid. There are openings a little wider than that
of a door in the east and west walls, in addition to the route south along the
hallway. Peeking through the openings reveals both rooms to be storage areas,
though from here in the hall it is hard to tell what they hold. You think you
see crates. There are sconces on the walls for torches, but there are none in
them now.

an armory, as your light casts shadows off the racks and hooks where weapons
once could have hung. To the west are some stairs carved out of the solid
rock. They lead up. The engineering required to manipulate the solid stone in
this area so precisely impresses you. There are sconces on the walls for
torches, but there are no torches in them now, leaving the hall dark except
for your light.

    This room is entirely unlike the rough, natural stone of the passages to
the north. It is apparently a storeroom, though it looks as if it has been
unused for some time. There are crates lining the walls, some of which are
broken and have spilled their contents onto the floor. Unfortunately, it
looks like whatever they once held was perishable, because all that is left
now is shards of broken glass and stains on the stone floor. There are also
some wooden planks from broken barrels, along with a couple of barrels that
are still intact, lined up against the south wall. There is a square opening
in the east wall, unlike the small jagged hole in the north that leads back to
the tunnels.

skeleton still loosely attached to one of the dry webs, complete with all the
gear its owner wore ages ago. It looks like a troglodyte skeleton.  There
crates in this room are all sealed and unbroken - whoever got at the stored
goods elsewhere apparently didn't have as much luck here. From the etchings on

a relatively scant amount of space between the table and the walls in which to
move about the room. The table is made of a wood-like substance, but unlike the
wall maps it shows no signs of the passage of time. There are fifteen or so
large chairs set around the table, at which the commanders at one time perched
to mull over their battle plans. The only exit is to the west.

    This room was probably pretty nice at one time, though it looks like it
has been looted several times since the original residents left. At one time
it had a door, but it has since been wrenched off it's hinges and now lies on
the ground. There is a bed, with the stuffing ripped out and spread all over
the room, then covered with a fine layer of dust, like everything else in
here. There is also a desk, tipped over on one side with one of the legs torn
off completely. There's no sign of it now. Whatever other furtinure was here

You know, the kind used for summoning and controlling demons. It's impossible

Very tastefully done motifs showing the rise and fall of various civilizations.
You think at least one of them may be depicting future events, as you can see

A small piece of furniture constructed of a strange organic material you do

continues to the south. The bare stone of the walls is here covered up with a
thin layer of some kind of wood, which has the effect of making the place look
less austere than elsewhere. It's too dark to tell what's north or east, but
you think the room to the west is a dining hall of some sort.

    This room has a rank smell, like something died in here. This in itself
would not be so amazing if it weren't true that whatever did die in here did
it a very long time ago. Despite the passage of time, there are still very
visible bloodstains on the walls, floor, and furniture here. The rusty red
color goes quite nicely with the black color of everything else in the room,
including the walls and all the furniture. This place really gives you the
creeps for some reason. The black bed and dresser seem to have been untouched
by the passage of time, and there is a mirror atop the dresser that is, quite
amazingly, unbroken. Doubtless an artifact of this room's having been sealed.

Guest's Quarters~
    The door to this room looks a bit battered, but at least it's still on its
hinges and capable of closing. The room is sparsely furnished, though it looks
like at one time it might have been rather nicely decorated. What is left of
the furniture in here is pretty much destroyed. What once might have been a
bed is now just a lot of broken wood and torn cloth scattered around the floor.
The dresser is in slightly better shape, at least you can still recognize how
the pieces once fit together. Everything is here is looking pretty broken. The
exit is east.

Bath~
    There are two pits in this room that once served as tubs for the officers
to bathe in. They are both dryed out now, though the channels in the floor
through which the water used to run are still intact. A small hole in the
north wall is the source of the channels in the floor that lead to the two
now-empty pits. A small hole at the bottom of each provides drainage. There
is a single exit, it is to the east.

hole inlet~
It's right where the floor meets the south wall, near the center. It's only
four inches wide, so you can't really tell where it comes from, though you
can tell it bends up after a few feet.
~
E
channel~
They are narrow gutters in the floor of the room through which water flowed
from the inlet hole in the south wall to the tubs. The main one is about three
inches deep, the others are only an inch or two in depth.
~
E
outlet drain~
It's pretty small, but by shining your light down it you can tell that it
curves after dropping a foot or so. It was made, it is not natural, just
like the pits themselves.
~
E
pit tub pits tubs~
It's about four feet deep and six feet in diameter. It is now empty, but once
water entered through the channels and left through a small hole in the bottom.
These pits were carved from the stone, they were not naturally formed.

Storage Room~
    This room is entirely unlike the rough, natural stone of the passages to
the north. It is apparently a storeroom, though it looks as if it has been
unused for some time. There are crates lining the walls, some of which are
broken and have spilled their contents onto the floor. Unfortunately, it
looks like whatever they once held was perishable, because all that is left
now is shards of broken glass and stains on the stone floor. There are also
some wooden planks from broken barrels, along with a couple of barrels that
are still intact, lined up against the south wall. There is a square opening
in the east wall, unlike the small jagged hole in the south that leads back to
the tunnels.

Swamp~
You have managed to step into a rather large pool of quicksand.  You start
to cry for help and find yourself choking on soft, wet sand.  You don't 
suffer much after your lungs fill up because a large sand slug puts you out 
of your misery.

The Grubby Cellar~
  You have found your way into a nasty, dirty room with lots of horrid 
smelling debris.  The first thing you notice is that the walls look strangely
fake, like they are made of some kind of plastic.  As you move to closer 
inspection you see that they have small bits of writing declaring them as
building materials stolen from a construction site.  The floor is dirt and 
rock, mostly dirt.  A few small spider webs have formed in the corners and
a hole, that looks to be the right size for a mouse, has been made in the 
north wall.  This place really smells and you wouldn't mind leaving it as
quickly as possible.

Hole in the ground~
This may be a hole in the ground to some people, but to Arioch, Homey, and
Gorby it's home.  As you walk in you notice the stench emanating from one of
the corners of the room.  As you walk in further you notice a small figure
huddled in a corner of the room.  He says "Hello, my names Rathead.  Who
are you?"  You cringe at the name of the famous thief.  He notices this 
reaction and reassures you, "I don't steal anymore," that is unless he's
bored.~

Feith's Sanctuary~
Well, actually, it's more of a den of thieves than a sanctuary....
To the north lies a dusty curtain, barely concealing the glare of uncertainty 
behind it. Don't bump into the sliding glass door to the west, through which
the voyeuristic thief can view the antics of his next-door neighbor on his
west. Meanwhile, to the east, a black circle shimmers on the wall, as if a
hole had been painted on it. AND, of course, the obligatory trap door on the 
floor concealed beautifully by ceramic tiles mosaically aligned on the floor.
up is... well...UP, ya know?

Ivy's Office~
Welcome to the interior of Ivy's pet cat Slut.  You must either be a very
powerful spell-caster, or the friend of one, even to be here.  We, however,
shan't even bore you with the details of how you got to be so small, and why
neither you, nor the organism that you presently are occupying, suffer from
this situation.  Let it be observed that the hostess and owner of said
organism probably is responsible and therefore thanked.  Should you like
to stay a while and chatter, there is a stomach that you could use as a 
sofa, or lungs that you could use a cushions, and hookworms that you can
discuss politics with.  Should you feel thirsty, just lean over and drink from
the spleen.  At any rate, welcome and make yourself at home.  Should Ivy not
be at home, please leave all in order seeing as Slut might have problems
digesting and breathing otherwise, to say the least.

Sunsor's Office~
     You are in a very luxuriously furnished room.  Against the far wall is a
giant marble desk with a very large black leather chair.  Directly opposite
the desk is an entertainment center with all the comforts of home.  Glancing
around some more, you suddenly realize that there is no floor in this room!
After some careful inspection, you realize that the entire floor is made of
glass, providing a breathtaking view of the city of Shadowdale.  Around the 
room, the walls are covered with charts.  On these charts, Sunsor keeps track
of all players' deeds (good and bad).  Suddenly, a large, black leather sofa
appears for you to sit upon.

Avenger's Tower~
    This room radiates some strange form of energy.  Even though small in
size, this room holds quite a large amount of equipment.  As you glance over
some of the brightly glowing objects, you notice several black pedestals that
were not there a moment ago.  Upon them are the most prized of all trophies:
Glaive, Avenger's weapon, floats above the pedestal, humming softly.  The head
of the Giant Purple Sand Worm is immortalized in a crystal sphere resting
now so lifelessly on it's pedestal.  The skull of the Dracolich glares at you
even now, you could almost swear that the eye sockets begin to glow red!
Finally, another pedestal comes into view, however nothing lies on it...
You wonder what else could possibly add to the collection when you notice the
word 'kris' carved into the base.

sign~
Welcome to the Elven Forest.  To help keep your visit a safe one, we ask
that you do not venture into parts of the forest in which you do not belong.
 
The forest is divided into three (3) segments:
 
1) The Pine Trail and The Brook.   (Intended for levels 1-3)

2) The Maple Grove and Meadow.     (Intended for levels 4-6)

3) The Orchard of the Elven King.  (Intended for levels 7-9)

Also, it would be more than wise to use the "buddy system" when fighting. 
It's saved lives in the past - it could save yours...
 
 
                                             Happy Hunting!

forest full of tall pines.  You look up in awe at these magnificent trees,
towering above everything in the forest.  The trail leads further to the
north, and you see what appears to be a brook to the west.  You also see some
broken branches in the brush to the east.  It seems possible to pass through
the brush in several spots.

    Here, in the middle of the forest trail, lies an old tree stump.  It looks
very sturdy and comfortable, and this seems to be a nice place to rest.  The

source of water to the west.  You also notice some broken branches in the
brush to the east.  It seems possible to pass through in that direction as

water is coming out from between two rocks, forming this gently flowing 
brook.  This looks like an excellent place to take a drink, since you have
never seen water as sparkling clear as this.  The brook continues north and
south, and you see an old tree stump on the shore to the east.

    You stand at the end of the Pine Trail, looking upon a large pond.  It
is a peaceful body of water, and you can see ducks swimming around, quacking
happily.  You also stop for a momemt to admire the pleasant sounds coming
from the pond.  The loons, frogs, ducks, and crickets all contribute to the
peaceful sounding atmosphere.  You are obviously not alone here, but you
definitely feel very safe.

The Widening Stream~
    You are now standing in a slightly larger body of water.  The brook
is widening and speeding up as it flows north into a pond.  The water also
gets deeper, and you cannot continue further north without a boat.

The pond~
    As you row out into the pond, you see more sights of the forest.  To
the west, a stream flows into the pond.  The pond continues to the north and
east, beyond which you can see trees on the shores.  You can't quite make
out what kind, but it is obvious that they are not pine trees.

In some thick underbrush~
    You are fighting your way through some thick brush.  By the look of the
broken branches around you, you aren't the first to try to travel this way.
This brush seems to be a divider of some sorts, as you can see a row of pine
trees west of here and a row of maple trees east of here.  The brush
continues to the north.

coloured lights puts you in the mood to dance to the music.  The sights and

If you want to kill other players enter here!~
    Basic Rule of Thumb: Do not kill any other player.

Don't even think of killing another player.  Even if that character is 
being extremely annoying or if that player is randomly killing other 
players.  Best thing for you to do is to duck into a peaceful room and 
wait for an immortal intervention.  If one immortal doesn't take care of
it ask another.  If there aren't any immortals on rent out and play at a
later time in the future.  Do not take the law in your own hands.  Cause
if you do act on your own accord, you'll be in as much trouble as the 
other person.

Punishment is severe.  You will lose levels and possibly the lost of your
character.  We will not put up with people destroying other people's 
enjoyment of this MUD.

If you want to steal from other players enter here!~
    Basic Rule of Thumb #2: Do not steal from other characters.

You should know better than to steal from players.  This includes linkdead
characters, sleeping characters and immortals.  If you think someone has
stolen from you, tell an immortal.  Do not steal your item back from the
other character.  Do not kill the other character to regain your item.
Do not ask other players gang up on the player to regain your item.  Do
not cast any type of control character spells on the player to gain an
item.  Tell an immortal about it.  Don't take the law in your own hands.

Punishment for stealing from another character is extremely severe.  This
may include lost of levels and lost of your character.

death. Looking down you see no trace of any bottom to the pit.  There
are a few spikes driven into the wall by some resourceful adventurer
before you.  Maby it is possible to climb out.  And maby it's possible
to slip and fall....

one circular wall look out over all the know world.  Looking down from one
of these you can see the base of the tower emerge from a clowd about 100 ft
below this level.

Chimney Entrance~
The walls here have been worked to buttress the ceiling. The
construction looks well weathered and at least several decades
old. The chamber is 70' feet across and nearly 40' high at its
highest point, where it opens to the mountain slope you came
from. A 30'-wide passage heads due west.  The floor has a polished,
black, mirrorlike surface that magnifies sounds and makes the 
slightest noise echo.

Storm's Lair~
This chamber is about 50' wide and over 200' long. The ceiling is a
good 30' above your head.  The place stinks with an overpowering
reptilian oder.  A layer of carbon coats the walls, floor and ceiling
and there are bones, bits of flesh, and peices of clothing and armor
scattered about.  No exits are apparant except the one to the east
which you entered.

featureless quarters throughout the rest of this complex. The floor
ceiling, and walls of the room have been completely covered with 
strange runes. Although the runework is impressive, your attention
is immediately drawn to what appears to be a large silvery orb that
partially protrudes from the wall opposite the door. The spherical
surface is nearly 7' across.

The Entrance to Deadhame~
     You stand at the mouth of a large, man made tunnel.  The smell
of rotting flesh is strong here.  The feeling that you are about
the only one in the area not yet dead comes over you, making chills
run down your spine.  A large sign looks like it should be examined.

sign~
     You are at the entrance to Deadhame, an area designed for low 
level characters to explore and conquer.  Most of the monsters here
are well-trained not to attack players unless provoked.  As one 
goes downstairs, he is likely to encounter greater challenges than
he would on the first level, and he might even cross paths with one
of the bad-tempered monsters.  If you are 1-3rd level, you would be
well advised to adventure here as part of a group, or you will find
yourself overwhelmed.  If you are well over 8th level, you may find
the challenges here to be fading, and it is likely time for you to
move on to bigger things.~

A hallway~
     You stand in a hallway which runs from East to West.  It is well
lighted, so vision is no problem here.  The Walls are hewn out of the
rocky earth about, and the ceiling is supported by sturdy wooden 
timbers.  The odor here is not too pleasant.

a roughly fashioned staircase.  A passage to the north is dark and
forboding, and likely full of creepy dead things.  The bottom of the 
stairs appears to be as light as it is up here.

A dead end~

much rougher than the others, and appears to be the site of current
expansion of the warrens.  You wonder why anyone would need to expand
a home that houses no fertile, living people, but it wasn't your
decision to make.

In the South Annex~

original construction was completed.  The quality of the tunnel is 
a little higher than to the north.  The ground, however is rough and
looks like it would really hurt to walk with no shoes.

In the South Annex~
     This area of the Deadhame appears to have been added after the 
original construction was completed.  The quality of the tunnel is 
a little higher than to the north.  The ground, however is rough and
looks like it would really hurt to walk with no shoes.

Inside a Small Stone Building~
   As you enter the room you see several weapons hung upon
the walls, just as you start to take some of the weaponry you
notice that is has long since rusted and is of no use to you.
At the far end of the room you notice a small table, a closer
look reveals the remains of what may have been a knight. The 
corpse, resting in a chair just behind the table appears to be
grasping something. Moving closer to the corpse you notice a
sword held tightly in the clutch on the skeletal figure, looking
at the sword you realize it is unlike the rest of the decayed
weaponry.... The blade appears to be razor sharp, and the metal
untarnished.

but unfortunatly you can not find any and you begin to fall! After
several minutes, you begin to wonder if there is any end to this
seemingly bottomless pit into which you have fallen. Just as you 
decide that there must be no end and that you will fall eternally,
you notice a bed of very large steel spikes fast approaching you,
Alas there is no escape. You cry out in agony as the spikes pierce

lich seated in the throne, the red glow of its eyes fixed dead upon you.
With a quick motion of its hand, the door from which you entered,

into the wall behind the throne of the lich! An evil laugh echoes

forest screams can be heard.  On the ground is a pile of cracked bones, drained
of all their marrow.  The trail runs north to west.  Large set of footprints

By the Dark Island~
   Just to your north you see a small island juts out of the water.  It is
rocky and without vegetation.  Farther north a crumbing black tower stands.
It may have once been an impressive sight but now is desolate and ruined.
From the top of the tower a bell begins to toll.

this must have once been a comfortable living area.  Large holes in the stone

On the Dark Path~
	You move onwards.  Torches burn on the sides of the path.  Skulls line
your way.  You break through a thin wall of webbing and move onward.  Your 
stomach is knotting up.  Sweat drips off your brow.  Just to the north you 
can make out a small misty clearing filled with figures. The hags are so close 
A dark chanting grows louder and louder.  This place REEKS with evil.  Shadows 
laugh and dance about you, taunting you to go further north.

The Clearing of The Hags~

The trees around you are dead, frozen in a silent scream.  The forces at work
here a poisoned the land.  A black crow with red glowing eyes watches you
from it's perch in the tree.  This place has been totally consumed by evil.
You can see shadows of otherworldly creatures dancing about at the edge of you

The creature grabs a number and asks another next to him,"Who's gonna kill you
today?"  Others line up to be express delivered to the battleground to be
hacked up yet again.

reach into a spar parts barrel grabbing a bone or a rotting member and try
to attach it to his pile of bones muttering ".. damn unions.."  After a few 
minuets a new member of the living dead sits up and grins.  Death gives him a 
hardy slap on that back and says,"Off you go, little one," and sends the 
creation slipping down the express chute to Darkenwood.

     WELCOME!!

The Land Down Under is mainly controlled by two groups: the Aborigines and
the Roos. Some of them don't care about outsiders, others..... well they
sometimes seem to come out of nowhere and attack without warning!!
    These two groups are at war with each other and will attack each other
if they see someone of the other side. Try not to get in their way....
    There are several dangerous creatures here, but with a bit of common
sense, you should be able to avoid most of them.
Good Luck and Enjoy your visit! (remember: you don't live here, they do...)

down and attack. It is best if you don't get in their way, but even then,
they have been known to come out of no where and attack outsiders. Watch
your step around here!!

the Roo area to the East and the Aborigines to the West. The River
continues to the North while to the South the water gets a bit shallower
to a River Crossing. As you listen, to the South you can faintly hear...
"thrashing?"... maybe it's just someone swimming....

You look to the South and see a few logs floating.... Wait! Those are
Crocodiles!   and they sure look hungry!

On the Eucalyptus River~
    The Eucalyptus River branches off of the Dark River here and goes to the
South. The trees are much too dense here to let you get off of the River.

In the Limbs of a Eucalyptus Tree~
    Up here, you see that the limbs of this huge tree support entire
communities of Koala Bears. The branches seem quite sturdy and can
support many people though they prevent you from seeing too far.

Immort's Fortress of Light~
You stand in the throne room of Immort's fortress.  Fabulous colors
greet your eyes.  The walls of the fortress are shining barriers of
impenetrable solid white light.  While the tapestries and furniture
are muted mixtures of solidified light in a stunning variety of
hues.  Before you sits the massive golden throne of the Lord Immort 
himself.  It glows brightly and you have trouble taking your eyes
from it so powerful is its appeal.  Despite the beauty, you cannot
forget this is a place of war.  All about you, massive warriors stand
at rigid attention, gleaming in their silvery armor.  For this is 
the bastion of all who serve the light, the heart of all that is
good in the universe.  So long as this fortress stands, good shall
ever remain dominant.

The Peapod~
This room is actually a gigantic pea pod.  Soft green light trickles in
through the walls, giving the room a comfortable feel.  A large round 
bed sits in the middle, shaped that so looking down on it, it 
looks like a pea.  On opposite walls, facing each other are
two pictures, one of a large pea, and the other, a small one.
Strangely enough they appear to be looking at each other, though
they are not black eyed peas so you wonder how that can be.
To one side of the bed sits a nightstand with a vase of everblooming
roses on it, a card sits at its base.  Above the bed is a picture
of the almighty platypus in the sky who guards this room proudly.
In one corner, a conversation pit as been set up, with two
beanbag chairs shaped like giant peas.  This is a very comfortable
place and you envy the two Peas their happiness together.

The card reads:
To my little pea,
These roses shall bloom evermore so long as our love shall last.
Every time you look at them, remember that always do i think of thee,
and always that thought brings me a special joy and warmth.
Remember to that always shall I be your pea.
I love you forever,
Big Pea

Path to Neutralis~
This lonely path leads to the west to a small walled city.  You get
the feeling it is not a very scenice spot as the trail is heavily 
overgrown with weeds, and shows little if any signs of recent use.

Path to Neutralis~
You stand outside the sad city of Neutralis.  Armed guards pace
the high walls at all times, stern and unforgiving, they appear
humorless and grim.  Wedged between the warring citadels to the
north and south, and the horrendous chaos zone to the west,
this is a city in a constant state of war.  You marvel at the
courage (or foolhardiness) of the individuals who would live
under such conditions.

Drawbridge~
You stand on a thick wooden drawbridge suspended high over a dry moat.
Menancing guards peer down at you suspiciously, you hear the ominous
click of crossbows being cocked all around you.

Inside the Gate~
You stand in the heart of a massive gateway.  The walls to either
side are riddled with arrow loops, while above you murder holes
glare down promising death to any who would threaten the safety of
the city.  It is almost as if the word target is writtin all over your
body.

Courtyard~
FInally free of the massive gateway!  A great weight has been lifted
from your shoulders, only to be replaced by another as you stare at
the squalor about you.  The sick, lame, poor, the refuse of society
all have been crammed into this courtyard.  The guards ignore them
and they return the favor.  A lingering odor of human feces clings
to everything here.  To the south you see a small shack with smoke 
rising from it, while to the north west, sits a long low ramshackle
building.

  The ornate massive doors hang open. Fluttering torches cast
dim yellow lickers of light from the entry way. Twenty feet
into the castle, a second set of doors suddenly swings open
effortlessly and the sounds of organ music flow out. Overhead,
in the entryway, four statues of dragons glare down, their eyes
flickering in the torchlight.

Central Entrance~
  Cobwebs hang from dust-covered columns of this great hall,
illuminated by torches fluttering in iron sconces. The dust and
webs cast strange, moving shadows across the faces of stone
gargoyles squatting motionlessly on the rim of the domed
ceiling. Cracked and faded ceiling frescoes are covered by cen-
turies of decay. Two doors of bronze stand closed to the north. To
the west, a wide staircase climbs into darkness. All the while,
sad and majestic organ tones float about you from a lit hallway
 to the east.

  Torchlight flutters against the walls of this vaulted hall. To the

that opening, a suit of armor, oiled and glistening, stands at
attention in a shallow alcove. To the south, large double doors
hang slightly open, a steady bright light escaping through the
opening. Swells of organ music come from behind the doors,
spilling their melody of power and defeat into the hall.

Dinning Hall~
 This is a magnificent 40-foot-square room, brilliantly lit by three
massive crystal chandeliers. Pillars of stone stand against dull
white marble walls, supporting the ceiling. In the center of the
room, a long, heavy table stands covered with a fine white satin
cloth. The table is laden with delectable foods of every type:roasted
beast basted in a savory sauce, roots and herbs of every taste,
and sweet fruits and vegetables. Places are set for each of you
with fine delicate china and silver. At each place there is a
crystal goblet filled with an amber liquid whose delicate fragrance
tantalizes your senses. At the center of the far west wall,
between floor-to-ceiling length mirrors, stands a massive organ.
Its pipes blare out a thunderous melody that offers in its tone
greatness and despair. Seated before the keys, its back toward you,
a single caped ligure pounds the keys in raptured ecstasy. The
figure suddenly stops and a deep silence fails over the dining
hall. The figure slowly turns toward you.

Staircase~
 Massive stairs rise to a landing 20 feet wide by 40 feet long. Stone
arches support a ceiling covered with frescos, 20 feet overhead. The
frescos faded lines depict the stone mountain atop which Ravenloft
stands, being taken by armored forces on horseback. The faces of
the characters in the fresco are scratched beyond recognition. Dust
floats in the air here, making it difficult to see details. There is
a staircase on the 20-foot-wide east wall. There are two alcoves
between the staircase. Light filtering through the dust shows two
suits of armor covered with dark stains, one standing in each alcove.
Each suit of armor holds a mace designed like a curved dragon head.
Engraved words on the arches above the alcoves are scratched out.

Directly across from the window are double doors in the north wall.
Ornate door carvings are obscured by a thick layer of dust. Further
east, a single door also leads from the north wall. At the far
eastern end of the hall, a huge throne stands atop a raised platform.

dusty china plates and stained silverware. In the center of the

frosting has lurned green with age. Cobwebs drape like dusty
lace down every side. A single doll figure of a welldressed woman

 A flaing hearth fire fills this room with rolling waves of red and
amber light. The walls are lined with ancient books and tomes, their
leather covers well oiled and preserved through careful use. All is
in order here. The stone floor is hidden beneath a luxurious rug of
a deep-pallerned weave. A large, low table sits in lhe center of
the room, waxed and polished to a mirrored finish. Even the poker
next to the blazing fireplace is polished. Large, overstuffed
divans and couches stand in order about the room. Two luxurious
chairs face the hearth. A huge painting hangs over the mantlepiece
in a heavy, gilded frame. The rolling light of the fire illuminates
the carefully rendered painling. It is an exact likeness of the
Burgomaster's daughter, Ireena Kotyana. Though the painting is
obviously centuries old, the likeness is unmistakable.

 This smoky room lies behind the fireplace. Glinting through the smoke,
gold, silver, and copper coins lie scattered around a closed chest.
The fittings on the chest tell of great workmanship. Attached to the
south wall are two torch sconces. The southernmost sconce holds a torch
with an intricate metal base. The other is empty. A skeleton of a man
lies against the wall in broken plate armor. His right hand is on his
throat while his left hand holds the matching torch from the empty sconce.

in the light of three candelabras sitting atop small tables about the
room. Tall white candles brun with bright, steady light. A large bed,
canopied by silken curtains, sits with its headboard against the west
wall. Luing amid the velvet and satin sheets and bedclothes is a woman
in a nightcoat. One of her dainty slipper has fallen to the floor at
the foot of the bed. Carved into the headboard with freat skill and

Hall Of Heros~
 Long, low moans drift down from alcoves that line both walls of this
long hall. The ceiling has fallen here, leaving rubble strewn across
the floor. Overhead, the beams of Ravenloft's roof are exposed. Sporadic
lightning from the clouds above flashes into this hall. A graven statue
stands within each of the 10 alcoves. Shafts of light cross the statues'
faces at obscure angles. Another sudden flash and crack of lightning
reveals their faces formed in the shapes of terrified men and women.

  A landing of flagstone 10 feet wide by 20 feet long wobbles slightly
underfoot. The chill draft of wind whistles mournfully through the

only for a single round through the landing, the wind continues down

Parapet Pentagram~
 This is the top of the tower. A turmoil of black, boiling clouds
rolls unceasingly over the dark towers of Ravenloft. The 60foot-diameter
tower roof is rimmed with broken parapets that drop into the swirling
mists of fog below. A slender stone bridge spans the gap between this
tower and the tower to the north, some 20 feetaway. To the north, the
high tower of Ravenloft thrusts skyward with no apparent opening at this
point.

15-foot-diameter hole drops into the cold heart of Ravenloft itself.
Cold air rushes up from the shaft sending a chill through your every
bone. Archers' slits line the walls. Aging beams support a steep roof.
One beam and part of the roof have fallen away,leaving a gaping hole

Twenty feet down the hallway, arched doorways lead downward 2 feet from

closed and partially submerged. All is still except for a weak cry for
help coming through the east door.

room. From their alcoves in the center of the north and south walls, two
iron statues stand saluting with their weapons bared. Each statue has
four arms, one with a shield, one with a sword, and the remaining two
with their palms toward the ceiling over their heads. Their eyes seem
to watch you as you walk about the room. High overhead, an hourglass
with writing on its base hangs suspended above the brazier. All of its
sand is in the upper portion, somehow refusing to run down into the
bottom. In the center of the room next to the brazier is a golden chest.

Entrance to the Troll Camp~
As you approach an opening in the trees, you faintly hear gutteral
voices nearby.  The ground here begins to soften and the trees all
seem to be mishapen and twisted.  The smell of decay hangs thick
in the air.  There is a battered sign here.

Passage in the Moors~
After moving through the entrance, you notice that the voices are
louder and seem to be coming from all sides.  A mist hangs in the
air here.  It is very humid and breathing is difficult.  The trail
goes east and west here.  The exit to the swamp lies south.

East-West passage through the swamp~
Flies buzz around your head as you start moving into the swamp. 
You catch glimpses of things moving in the fetid waters, things
that you probably don't want to meet.  The passage heads east and west.

light shining through the trees to the north.  The trail leads

many burning sensations on your body...Ack..leeches!  You quickly
pull them off before they can cause any harm.  The trail continues

The trail turns north here, leading even deeper into the gloom.
You are startled by a loud splash!  Looking around, you feel
relieved to see that it was just a dead branch that fell into the
water...but why did it fall?
The path goes west and north.

Large mound~
This appears to be a nest of some sort.  You hear a croaking 
noise that sounds too deep to be from a frog.  You hear a
sound at the water's edge and turn to see a large alligator
coming out of the water.  It might not be a bad idea to move.

Mason's House of Ball-Peen Hammers, Wood-screws and Large-screen Color TVs~

piled up on the floor.  The room is certainly 'lived' in.
